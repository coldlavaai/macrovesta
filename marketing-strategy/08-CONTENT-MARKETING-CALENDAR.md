```
After 20+ years in cotton commodities, I've finally solved the Friday problem.

You know the one:

‚Üí Thursday 11 AM: USDA Export Sales drops. Spend 2 hours analyzing.
‚Üí Friday 3:30 PM: COT report drops. Spend 3 hours analyzing.
‚Üí Friday evening: Write client summaries. Spend 2 hours.
‚Üí Weekend: Catch up on Crop Progress. Another 2 hours.

10 hours/week. Every. Single. Week.

Last year I asked: "What if AI could do this for me?"

So I built Macrovesta.

Now I get plain-language WhatsApp alerts in 30 seconds:
"Managed money short 62,004 contracts (up 8,000). Bearish signal."

Forward to clients. Done.

Just opened free trials to the industry. Comment "FRIDAY" if you want to test it.

**Goal:** 50-100 comments, 10-20 DM inquiries

#### Wednesday (Day 3)

**LinkedIn Post #2: Educational Value**
```
How to Read CFTC COT Reports in 5 Minutes (Not 3 Hours)

Most cotton advisors spend 2-3 hours every Friday analyzing COT data.

Here's the shortcut I use:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Focus on Managed Money positioning
   ‚Üí Speculators, not hedgers (that's the market sentiment signal)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Look for week-over-week CHANGES
   ‚Üí Absolute numbers don't matter. Direction matters.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Identify extremes
   ‚Üí Highest short position in 6 months? That's actionable.

Example from last Friday:
üìä Managed money short 62,004 contracts (UP 8,000 from last week)
üìà Bearish positioning at 3-month high
‚ö†Ô∏è Expect downward price pressure

This is the exact analysis Macrovesta delivers automatically.

What's your Friday COT workflow? Drop it in comments.

#CottonTrading #COTReport #MarketAnalysis
```
**Goal:** Demonstrate expertise, soft-sell product

#### Friday (Day 5)

**LinkedIn Post #3: Real-Time Insight (Friday 4 PM - After COT drops)**
```
üö® Cotton Market Alert: This Week's COT Report

Just analyzed this week's CFTC COT data (dropped 30 minutes ago).

Here's what matters:

üìä Managed money short 58,992 contracts (DOWN 3,012 from last week)
üìà Speculators covering short positions
‚úÖ Mildly bullish signal

Translation: Large traders are betting cotton prices stabilize or rise.

This analysis took me 30 seconds with Macrovesta.
(It used to take me 3 hours.)

What's your take on cotton over the next 30 days?

#CottonMarket #USDA #Commodities
```
**Goal:** Show product in action, drive FOMO (they're still analyzing manually)

---

**Email Follow-Up (Day 4 - Thursday AM)**
```
Subject: Your first USDA Export Sales alert arrives in 3 hours

Hi [Name],

This is it - your first live Macrovesta alert!

At 11 AM (when USDA Export Sales drops), you'll get a WhatsApp message with:
‚Üí Week-over-week sales changes
‚Üí Bullish or bearish signal
‚Üí Plain-language interpretation

All you need to do: Forward it to clients, add your insights. Done.

Let me know how it goes!

Joe

### Week 2

#### Monday

**Blog Post #1: "The Hidden Cost of Manual Report Analysis"**

**Slug:** `/blog/hidden-cost-manual-report-analysis`

**Outline:**
```
Introduction: The Friday Grind
- Most commodity advisors spend 8-10 hours/week on report analysis
- That's 480 hours/year - 12 full workweeks
- What if that time could be automated?

Section 1: Breaking Down the Time Cost
- Thursday 11 AM: USDA Export Sales (2-3 hours)
- Friday 3:30 PM: CFTC COT Report (2-3 hours)
- Weekly: Cotton on Call, Crop Progress (2-3 hours)
- Friday evening: Client summaries (2 hours)

Section 2: The Financial Impact
- Calculate your hourly rate (¬£30/¬£50/¬£75/¬£100+)
- Example: 10 hours/week √ó ¬£50/hour √ó 52 weeks = ¬£26,000/year
- That's the time COST, not counting tool subscriptions

Section 3: The Opportunity Cost
- What could you do with 10 extra hours/week?
  - Take on 2-3 more clients (¬£20K-30K additional revenue)
  - Build new service offerings
  - Actually have weekends
  - Spend time with family

Section 4: Automation Solutions Are Here
- Technology has caught up to commodities
- AI can interpret government reports in seconds
- Example: Macrovesta (link)
- Cost: ¬£1,800/year vs ¬£26,000/year in time

Conclusion: Do the Math
- Download our Free Friday Workflow Audit (lead magnet CTA)
- Calculate your true cost
- See if automation makes sense

#### Wednesday

**LinkedIn Post #4: Behind-the-Scenes**
```
"Joe, you're putting yourself out of business."

That's what someone told me when I launched Macrovesta.

Here's the thing: I'm NOT out of business.

Liverpool Cotton Brokers is thriving. Earlam & Partners has more clients than ever.

Why? Because I'm not spending 10 hours/week on repetitive data gathering.

I'm spending it on:
‚Üí High-value client consultancy
‚Üí Building new relationships
‚Üí Actually thinking about the market (not copy-pasting PDFs)

Automation doesn't replace expertise. It amplifies it.

That's the insight that built Macrovesta.

What repetitive task is stealing your time?

**LinkedIn Post #5: Live Market Analysis + Social Proof**
```
Cotton Market Update (Oct 28, 2025)

This week's COT analysis:

üìä Managed money short 61,450 contracts (up 2,458)
üìà Bearish positioning increasing
‚ö†Ô∏è Watch for continued downward pressure

One advisor who tested Macrovesta this week said:

"I used to dread Fridays. Now I get the COT alert at 3:30 PM, forward it to clients with a quick note, and I'm done. 30 seconds. Game changer."

DMs are open if you want to try it this week.

### Week 3-4

**LinkedIn Content:**
- Continue Monday/Wednesday/Friday cadence
- Mix of educational posts, product demonstrations, testimonials
- Engage in comments daily (5-10 comments on other advisors' posts)

**Guest Article Pitch (Week 3):**

**Target:** Cotton Outlook, Cotton Grower Magazine, AgFunder News

**Pitch Email:**
```
Subject: Guest article idea - "Why Cotton Advisors Are Burning Out on Fridays"

Hi [Editor Name],

Joe Earlam here from Earlam & Partners / Liverpool Cotton Brokers.

I've been in cotton commodities for 20+ years, and I'm seeing a troubling trend: advisor burnout.

The culprit? Manual report analysis. Most advisors spend 8-10 hours/week (480 hours/year) manually analyzing USDA, CFTC, and crop reports.

I'd love to write a guest article for [Publication] on this topic:

**Proposed Title:** "The Hidden Cost of Manual Report Analysis: Why Cotton Advisors Are Burning Out"

**Angle:**
- The Friday grind (COT at 3:30 PM, etc.)
- Time and financial cost calculation
- Impact on work-life balance and advisor retention
- Technology solutions emerging (automation, AI)
- How younger advisors are approaching this differently

This is NOT a product pitch - it's thought leadership on a real industry problem.

I can deliver 800-1,200 words by [date].

Interested?

Best,
Joe Earlam

## MONTH 2: Phase 2 Start - Scale with Paid Ads

### Week 5

#### Monday

**Blog Post #2: "5 Ways Cotton Advisors Waste Time (And How to Fix Them)"**

**Slug:** `/blog/5-ways-cotton-advisors-waste-time`

**Outline:**
```
Introduction: Time Is Your Most Valuable Asset
- As an independent advisor, your time = your revenue
- But most advisors waste 15-20 hours/week on low-value tasks
- Here are the biggest time sinks (and how to fix them)

Time Waster #1: Manual Report Analysis (8-10 hours/week)
- Problem: Copy-pasting data from USDA, CFTC PDFs
- Cost: ¬£20,000-26,000/year in time value
- Solution: Automate with AI tools (Macrovesta, etc.)

Time Waster #2: Spreadsheet Maintenance (2-3 hours/week)
- Problem: Manually updating price sheets, COT data
- Solution: Use APIs, automated data pulls

Time Waster #3: Writing Client Summaries from Scratch (2-3 hours/week)
- Problem: Re-explaining same concepts every week
- Solution: Template your summaries, personalize key insights only

Time Waster #4: Chasing Down Data Sources (1-2 hours/week)
- Problem: Bookmark spaghetti (USDA site, CFTC site, ICE, etc.)
- Solution: Centralized dashboard or automated alerts

Time Waster #5: Unstructured Client Communication (2-3 hours/week)
- Problem: Answering same questions via email/phone repeatedly
- Solution: Weekly group update + office hours for Q&A

Conclusion: Reclaim 15+ Hours Per Week
- Total time saved: 15-20 hours/week
- That's 780-1,040 hours/year (equivalent to 19-26 workweeks)
- What would you do with an extra month per year?

**LinkedIn Post #6: Objection Handling**
```
"I prefer to do my own analysis."

I hear this a lot about Macrovesta.

And I get it. Your expertise is what clients pay for.

Here's the thing: Macrovesta doesn't replace your analysis.

It replaces the 2 hours you spend copy-pasting data from PDFs.

You still:
‚úÖ Review the insights (takes 30 seconds)
‚úÖ Add your unique market perspective
‚úÖ Make the final call for clients

You just don't spend Friday evening manually counting COT contracts.

Think of it like spell-check for writing.

Spell-check doesn't make you a worse writer. It just saves you time on typos so you can focus on the message.

Automation amplifies expertise. It doesn't replace it.

What's your take?

**LinkedIn Post #7: Case Study Tease**
```
How One Cotton Advisor Got His Fridays Back

Before Macrovesta:
‚è∞ Friday 3:30 PM: COT drops
‚è∞ Friday 3:31 PM - 6:30 PM: Analyzing data
‚è∞ Friday 7:00 PM: Writing client summaries
‚è∞ Friday 8:30 PM: Finally emails clients

After Macrovesta:
üì± Friday 3:30 PM: WhatsApp alert arrives
üì± Friday 3:32 PM: Forward to clients with 2-sentence note
‚úÖ Friday 3:33 PM: Done. Weekend starts.

### Week 6

#### Monday

**Blog Post #3: "Why Bloomberg Terminal Isn't Enough for Cotton Advisors"**

**Slug:** `/blog/why-bloomberg-terminal-isnt-enough-cotton-advisors`

**Outline:**
```
Introduction: The Bloomberg Myth
- Many advisors think: "If I just had Bloomberg, I'd be set"
- Bloomberg costs ¬£24,000/year
- But it doesn't solve the Friday problem

Section 1: What Bloomberg Does Well
- Real-time pricing (futures, options)
- News aggregation
- Financial analytics
- Messaging (for traders)

Section 2: What Bloomberg Doesn't Do
- ‚ùå Automated report interpretation
- ‚ùå Plain-language insights
- ‚ùå WhatsApp/mobile-first delivery
- ‚ùå Cotton-specific analysis

Section 3: The Cotton Advisor Gap
- Bloomberg gives you data
- You still spend 3 hours analyzing COT reports
- You still manually interpret USDA Export Sales
- Bloomberg = Tool. Not a solution.

Section 4: The Middle Market Opportunity
- Free tools: ¬£0/year (DIY analysis, 10 hours/week)
- Bloomberg: ¬£24,000/year (still requires manual analysis)
- Macrovesta: ¬£1,800/year (automated analysis, 30 seconds/week)

Section 5: What Cotton Advisors Actually Need
- Cotton-specific data sources (not generic commodities)
- Automated interpretation (not just data dumps)
- Mobile-first delivery (WhatsApp, not desktop terminals)
- Affordable pricing (not enterprise)

Conclusion: The Best of Both Worlds
- Many advisors use BOTH Bloomberg (for pricing) and Macrovesta (for reports)
- Total cost: ¬£25,800/year
- Time saved: 480 hours/year
- ROI: Massive

CTA: Compare Your Current Workflow (lead magnet)

"I've been a cotton advisor for 15 years.

I've never had a tool that actually saved me TIME.

Most tools just give me MORE data to analyze.

Macrovesta is different. It does the analysis FOR me.

Friday COT report used to take 3 hours. Now it takes 30 seconds.

I forward the WhatsApp alert to clients, add my take, done.

Game changer."

### Week 9

#### Monday

**Blog Post #6: "ROI Calculator: Is Automation Worth It for Your Advisory Practice?"**

**Slug:** `/blog/roi-calculator-automation-commodity-advisors`

**Outline:**
```
Introduction: The Automation Question
- "Should I automate my workflow?"
- Most advisors ask about cost, not ROI
- Here's how to calculate if automation is worth it

Section 1: Calculate Your Current Cost
Step 1: Time Tracking
- How many hours/week on report analysis? (avg: 8-10)
- How many hours/week on data gathering? (avg: 2-3)
- How many hours/week on client summaries? (avg: 2-3)
- Total: 12-16 hours/week

Step 2: Time Valuation
- What's your effective hourly rate?
  - Revenue / (hours worked per year) = ¬£X/hour
- Example: ¬£200K revenue / 2,000 hours = ¬£100/hour
- Time cost: 12 hours/week √ó ¬£100/hour √ó 52 weeks = ¬£62,400/year

Step 3: Add Tool Costs
- Bloomberg: ¬£24,000/year (if you have it)
- SpreadCharts: ¬£1,200/year
- Other subscriptions: ¬£X/year

Total Current Cost: ¬£X/year

Section 2: Calculate Automation Savings
Option 1: Partial Automation (Macrovesta)
- Cost: ¬£1,800/year
- Time saved: 10 hours/week (report analysis)
- New time cost: 2 hours/week √ó ¬£100/hour √ó 52 weeks = ¬£10,400/year
- Total cost: ¬£1,800 + ¬£10,400 = ¬£12,200/year
- Savings: ¬£62,400 - ¬£12,200 = ¬£50,200/year

Section 3: ROI Beyond Money
- Less stress (no more Friday panic)
- Better work-life balance (actually have weekends)
- Client satisfaction (faster, more consistent updates)
- Scalability (can take on more clients)

Section 4: When Automation ISN'T Worth It
- You enjoy manual analysis (it's your favorite part)
- You work <20 hours/week total
- Your revenue is <¬£50K/year
- You're planning to retire soon

Conclusion: Run Your Own Numbers
- Use our Free ROI Calculator (lead magnet)
- Calculate YOUR specific savings
- Make an informed decision

**LinkedIn Post #10: Vulnerability / Founder Story**
```
I almost gave up on Macrovesta.

July 2024. 9 months into building it.

I'd spent ¬£50K in development.
Zero customers.
No revenue.

My wife asked: "Are you sure people want this?"

I wasn't.

But I kept going because I KNEW the problem was real.

I'd lived it for 20 years.

Every. Single. Friday. 3:30 PM. COT report drops.

3 hours of my life. Gone.

So I kept building.

October 2024: First paying customer.
"This is exactly what I needed."

December 2024: 10 customers.

February 2025: 30 customers.

Now: Launching to the wider industry.

The lesson?

If you KNOW the problem is real (because you've lived it), keep going.

Even when it's hard.
