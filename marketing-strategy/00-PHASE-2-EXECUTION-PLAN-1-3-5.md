# Macrovesta Phase 2 Execution Plan (1-3-5 Framework)
**Weeks 5-12: Scale with Paid Acquisition**
**Version 1.0 - October 28, 2025**
**Prepared by: Cold Lava for Macrovesta**

---

## The 1-3-5® Methodology

This plan uses the 1-3-5® business planning framework - the **lifeblood** of our strategy:

- **THE 1** = One crystal-clear vision of success (written as if already achieved)
- **THE 3** = Three mission-critical objectives that enable the vision
- **THE 5** = Five action-oriented goals per objective (15 total actions)

---

# THE 1: Our Phase 2 Vision (Ultimate Goal)

## "By the end of Week 12, we have 25-35 total paying Macrovesta customers generating £3,750-£5,250 monthly recurring revenue, with Google Ads and LinkedIn Ads both proven to work at acceptable CAC (<£250), organic content starting to produce leads, and clear understanding of what messaging converts."

**Success Metrics (Starting from 6-8 customers after Phase 1):**
- ✅ 25-35 total paying customers (17-27 new customers in Phase 2)
- ✅ £3,750-£5,250 MRR
- ✅ Google Ads: 10-15 new customers at <£250 CAC (testing and learning)
- ✅ LinkedIn Ads: 5-10 new customers at <£300 CAC (more expensive but worth testing)
- ✅ Content marketing: 2-5 organic customers (long-tail, starting to work)
- ✅ <20% churn rate (still learning and improving)
- ✅ 300-500 monthly organic website visitors (building SEO foundation)
- ✅ 5-8 total video testimonials (building social proof library)

**Why This Matters:**
- **Proves paid acquisition can work** (even at modest scale)
- **Establishes baseline CAC** for each channel (can optimize in Phase 3)
- **Tests messaging at scale** beyond warm network (different from Phase 1)
- **Builds organic content foundation** (compounds over time)
- **Validates LTV:CAC ratio** >6:1 (healthy for B2B SaaS)
- **Creates social proof assets** for scaling in Phase 3

---

# THE 3: Mission-Critical Objectives

## Objective 1: "Google Search Ads have generated 10-15 new paying customers at <£250 CAC"

**Why This Is Critical:**
Google Search Ads target high-intent advisors actively searching for solutions ("cotton report automation", "commodity advisor tools", "Bloomberg alternative"). These are the warmest cold leads - they know they have the Friday problem and are looking for answers.

This is Phase 2's primary testing ground - if we can't make Google work at £1,000-1,200/month spend, we need to fix messaging before scaling.

**Realistic Expectations:**
- 8 weeks of testing (Weeks 5-12)
- £1,000-1,200/month budget = £8,000-9,600 total spend
- Target: 10-15 paying customers
- CAC: £200-250 acceptable for testing phase (can optimize later)
- **This objective proves paid acquisition can work**

---

## Objective 2: "LinkedIn Ads have generated 5-10 new paying customers at <£300 CAC"

**Why This Is Critical:**
LinkedIn allows precise targeting by job title ("Commodity Advisor", "Cotton Broker", "Agricultural Analyst"). While more expensive than Google, LinkedIn reaches advisors who aren't actively searching yet - building awareness and capturing them before competitors do.

This diversifies acquisition channels (not dependent on Google alone) and tests whether targeting beats intent-based search.

**Realistic Expectations:**
- 8 weeks of testing (Weeks 5-12)
- £700-1,000/month budget = £5,600-8,000 total spend
- Target: 5-10 paying customers
- CAC: £250-300 acceptable for testing (LinkedIn is pricier, but worth testing)
- **This objective proves channel diversification**

---

## Objective 3: "Content marketing has produced 2-5 organic customers with 300-500 monthly visitors"

**Why This Is Critical:**
Paid ads are expensive and stop when you stop paying. Organic content creates compound growth - each blog post continues generating traffic and leads months after publication. This builds long-term acquisition foundation.

Phase 2 is about planting content seeds that will compound in Phase 3 and beyond.

**Realistic Expectations:**
- 9 blog posts published over 8 weeks
- SEO takes 2-3 months to work (content published in Week 5-8 may not rank until Week 12+)
- Target: 300-500 monthly organic visitors by Week 12 (early traction)
- 2-5 organic customers realistic (long-tail conversions)
- **This objective builds the foundation for future free acquisition**

---

Subject: Quick question about your Friday workflow

Hi [First Name],

I noticed you're a [Job Title] at [Company]. Quick question:

How much time do you spend analysing USDA and COT reports each week?

Most cotton advisors I talk to say 8-10 hours. At £50/hour, that's £26,000/year in time cost.

We built Macrovesta to solve this. It's an AI-powered platform that automates government report analysis and delivers plain-language insights to WhatsApp.

Example: Friday at 3:30 PM when COT drops, instead of spending 3 hours manually analysing, you get:

"Managed money short 62,004 contracts (up 8,000 from last week). Bearish positioning for cotton."

Forward to clients, done.

£150/month vs Bloomberg's £24,000/year.

Worth 15 minutes to see how it works?

Joe Earlam
