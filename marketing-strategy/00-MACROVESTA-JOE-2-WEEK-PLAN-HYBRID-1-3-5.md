# Macrovesta (Joe): Phase 1 Hybrid Execution Plan (1-3-5 Framework)
**Next 2 Weeks: October 28 - November 10, 2025**
**Execution Model:** Hybrid (Cold Lava handles scale, Joe handles VIP relationships + demos)
**Prepared for:** Joe Earlam, Macrovesta Founder

---

## The 1-3-5® Methodology

- **THE 1** = One crystal-clear vision of success (what YOU achieve by end of 2 weeks)
- **THE 3** = Three mission-critical objectives that enable the vision
- **THE 5** = Five action-oriented goals per objective (15 total actions)

---

# THE 1: Joe's 2-Week Vision

## "By November 10, 2025, I have given Cold Lava everything they need to launch Phase 1 on my behalf (account access, contact lists, template approvals), identified my 5-10 VIP contacts I'll reach out to personally, and I'm confident and ready to focus on demos and closing deals while Cold Lava handles the execution."

**Success Metrics:**
- ✅ Email account access granted to Cold Lava
- ✅ LinkedIn account access granted to Cold Lava
- ✅ Liverpool Cotton Brokers email list exported and shared
- ✅ 20-30 personal network contacts identified and shared (with relationship context)
- ✅ 5-10 VIP contacts identified that I'll handle personally
- ✅ 3-5 industry favour-ask targets identified
- ✅ Liverpool Cotton Brokers email template reviewed and approved
- ✅ Personal network email templates reviewed and approved
- ✅ My calendar is clear for demos starting Week 1
- ✅ I feel confident Cold Lava will represent me authentically

**Why This Matters:**
- Cold Lava can't execute without my access and approvals
- VIP relationships need my personal touch - I'm the differentiator
- Phase 1 success depends on my warm network - I'm leveraging decades of relationships
- **I focus my time where it matters most: VIPs + demos + strategy**
- Cold Lava handles the scale work (email blasts, follow-ups, LinkedIn, tracking)

---

# THE 3: Mission-Critical Objectives

## Objective 1: "Cold Lava has access to my accounts and I'm confident they'll represent me authentically"

**Why This Is Critical:**
If I don't grant access, Cold Lava can't execute. If I don't trust they'll sound like me, I won't grant access. This objective is about trust and enablement - getting comfortable with done-for-you execution.

**My Role:** Provide access, set boundaries, approve messaging
**Target Completion:** November 5 (Week 1)

---

## Objective 2: "My contact lists are organized and I've identified which relationships need my personal touch"

**Why This Is Critical:**
I know my network better than anyone. Some relationships are transactional (Cold Lava can handle). Some are deeply personal (I must handle). This objective is about playing to my strengths - focusing my limited time on highest-value relationships.

**My Role:** Export lists, provide context, prioritize VIPs
**Target Completion:** November 7 (Week 2)

---

## Objective 3: "I've reviewed and approved all messaging and I'm ready to show up to demos Cold Lava books for me"

**Why This Is Critical:**
Templates must sound like me. If prospects reply "this doesn't sound like Joe," the whole strategy fails. I need to review everything once, approve it, and trust Cold Lava to execute in my voice.

**My Role:** Review templates, approve messaging, commit to showing up for demos
**Target Completion:** November 10 (end of Week 2)

---

**Time Commitment:** 30-45 minutes

---

### Action 2.3: Identify 5-10 VIP Contacts I'll Handle Personally
**Owner:** Joe
**Deadline:** November 6
**Deliverable:** Short list of VIPs I'll reach out to myself

**Who Qualifies as VIP:**
- Close personal friends in the industry
- Past clients who'd be offended if outreach wasn't personal
- People who owe me favours
- Relationships where my personal touch is the differentiator

**My Action:**
1. From the 20-30 personal network contacts, flag 5-10 as "VIP - Joe handles"
2. These are the people Cold Lava will NOT contact
3. I'll reach out to these 5-10 personally during Week 1-2

**Example VIPs:**
- John Smith (ABC Cotton) - Past client, close friend, drinks together regularly
- Sarah Jones (XYZ Trading) - Mentor from early career, she'd want personal touch
- Michael Brown (Cotton Outlook) - Industry influencer, personal relationship

**What I'll Do:**
- Send personal emails to these 5-10 (use templates as starting point, but customize heavily)
- Make phone calls if appropriate
- Leverage personal relationship to ask for favour ("I'd love your feedback...")

**Time Commitment:** 20-30 minutes (planning), 2-3 hours (execution in Week 1)

---

### Action 2.4: Identify 3-5 Industry Favour-Ask Targets
**Owner:** Joe
**Deadline:** November 6
**Deliverable:** List of 3-5 industry influencers I'll reach out to personally

**Who Qualifies:**
- Trade association leaders (National Cotton Council, ICAC)
- Industry publication editors (Cotton Outlook, Cotton Grower Magazine)
- Influencers with large followings (LinkedIn, industry forums)
- Conference organizers
- People with platforms who can share Macrovesta to their networks

**What I'm Asking:**
- "Would you share Macrovesta with your network?"
- "Can I write a guest article for your publication?"
- "Would you mention this in your next newsletter?"

**My Action:**
1. Identify 3-5 people who:
   - Have reach (500+ followers, newsletter subscribers, association members)
   - Know and respect me personally
   - Would do me a favour
2. These are high-leverage relationships - I must handle personally
3. Cold Lava will NOT contact these people (too sensitive)

**Example Targets:**
- Jane Doe (Cotton Outlook editor) - Could mention in newsletter to 10K subscribers
- Bob Smith (National Cotton Council) - Could share with member list
- Lisa Green (LinkedIn influencer, 5K followers) - Could post about Macrovesta

**Time Commitment:** 15 minutes (planning), 1-2 hours (execution in Week 2-3)

---

### Action 2.5: Provide Relationship Context for Each Contact
**Owner:** Joe
**Deadline:** November 7
**Deliverable:** Cold Lava knows the backstory for each contact

**Why This Matters:**
Cold Lava needs context to write authentic emails. If I just give a list of names, they can't personalize. If I give relationship context, they can write emails that sound like I wrote them.

**My Action:**
For each of the 15-20 contacts Cold Lava will handle, add 1-2 sentences of context:

**Example:**
| Name | Email | Relationship Context |
|------|-------|---------------------|
| Tom Jones | tom@example.com | Met at ICAC 2024, we talked about automating crop reports, seemed interested |
| Alice Brown | alice@example.com | Past consulting client from 2020, helped them with hedging strategy, still friendly |
| Mark Davis | mark@example.com | LinkedIn connection, engaged with my posts, never met in person but follows my work |

**What Cold Lava Will Do:**
- Use this context to personalize emails
- Reference the relationship naturally: "Great talking with you at ICAC about automation..."
- Make it sound authentically like I wrote it

**Time Commitment:** 20 minutes

---

4. Approve subject line (3 variations provided - pick one or suggest alternative)
