## Investment Summary

### Upfront Setup Fee: £1,500 (Due: November 1, 2025)
**Covers:** Infrastructure, contact database, messaging templates, demo script, execution plan

---

### Phase 1 Execution (8 Weeks): £2,250/Month × 2 Months = £4,500
**Covers:** 100% of outreach, tracking, follow-ups, LinkedIn activity, demo booking management

**Alternative:** Hourly at £75/hour (estimated 45-55 hours total = £3,375-4,125)

---

### Total Phase 1 Investment: £6,000 (Setup + 2 months execution)

**Expected ROI:**
- Conservative outcome: 6-8 total customers = £900-1,200 MRR = 10.8-14.4K annual revenue
- Optimistic outcome: 10-13 total customers = £1,500-1,950 MRR = 18-23.4K annual revenue
- **Payback period: 4-6 months** (assuming customers stay for 12+ months)
- **LTV:CAC Ratio: 3:1 to 4:1** (healthy B2B SaaS benchmark)

---

## Why This Model Works

### 1. Leverages Joe's Assets (Network, Credibility, Product Knowledge)
- Cold Lava executes from Joe's accounts (email, LinkedIn) using his voice
- Prospects see messages from Joe Earlam (trusted industry figure), not a marketing agency
- Joe's decades of relationships and credibility drive response rates

---

### 2. Protects Joe's Time for Highest-Value Activities
- Joe focuses on: Demos (closing deals), product improvements, strategic decisions
- Joe does NOT waste time on: Sending emails, tracking spreadsheets, managing follow-ups
- **Result:** Joe's time is leveraged 10x (1 hour of Joe's demo time = 10 hours of Cold Lava execution work)

---

### 3. Professional Execution at Scale
- Cold Lava handles: Daily execution, response monitoring, metrics tracking, follow-up sequences
- Ensures: Nothing gets missed, every lead is nurtured, every demo is booked and confirmed
- **Result:** Higher conversion rates because execution is consistent and professional

---

### 4. Clear Accountability and Metrics
- Weekly reports show: Emails sent, responses, demos booked, trial signups, conversions
- Joe always knows: What Cold Lava is doing, what's working, what's not
- **Result:** Trust and transparency (Joe can see progress in real-time)

---

### 5. Low-Risk, High-ROI Start
- Phase 1 budget: £6,000 total (£1,500 setup + £4,500 execution)
- Phase 1 target: 6-8 total customers = £900-1,200 MRR
- If Phase 1 works → Scale to Phase 2 (paid ads, content marketing)
- If Phase 1 doesn't work → Joe has validated product-market fit data (what messaging resonated, what didn't)
