# PHASE 1: WARM OUTREACH (Joe's Network)

## EMAIL 1: Initial Warm Introduction

**Subject:** Quick question about your Friday workflow

**To:** [Advisor in Joe's network]

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

Hope you're well! Quick question:

How much time does your team spend analyzing USDA and COT reports each week?

I ask because we just launched something at Macrovesta that automates the entire process - turns 10 hours of Friday analysis into 30-second WhatsApp alerts.

Example: Friday at 3:30 PM, instead of spending 3 hours analyzing COT data, you get:

"Managed money short 62,004 contracts (up 8,000 from last week). Bearish positioning for cotton."

Forward it to clients, done.

Worth a 15-minute demo? I'd love to show you what last Friday's reports would have looked like.

Best,
Joe / Macrovesta Team

P.S. - 14-day free trial if you want to test it this week. No credit card needed.
```

**Personalization Variables:**
- `[Name]` - Replace with first name
- Optional: Add specific context if you know their workflow ("Last time we talked, you mentioned spending weekends on reports...")

## EMAIL 2: Follow-Up (+3 Days, No Response)

**Subject:** Re: Quick question about your Friday workflow

**To:** [Same advisor]

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

Following up on my note about automating report analysis.

Just to give you an idea: most advisors we talk to spend 8-10 hours/week on this. At ¬£50/hour, that's ¬£20,000-26,000/year in time value.

Macrovesta costs ¬£1,800/year and gives you those hours back.

Worth 15 minutes to see how it works?

Book a time: [Calendly Link]

Best,
Joe

P.S. - Here's a 2-minute video if you'd rather just watch: [Loom Link]

## EMAIL 3: Final Touch (+7 Days, Value Gift)

**To:** [Same advisor]

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

Don't want to keep bothering you, so this is my last email.

Even if Macrovesta isn't a fit right now, I thought you might find value in our latest cotton market analysis (attached).

And if you ever want to see how we automate the Friday grind, we're here.

Best,
Joe

P.S. - Here's the trial link if you want to test it this week: [Link]

# PHASE 2: COLD OUTREACH (Advisors)

## EMAIL 4: Problem-Aware (Variant A: Time Savings)

**Subject:** Spending 8+ hours/week on cotton market research?

**To:** [Cold advisor prospect from LinkedIn/industry list]

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

I help cotton advisors at [Similar Company 1] and [Similar Company 2] cut market research time by 75%.

Most cotton advisors we talk to are frustrated by:
- Juggling 10+ data sources (USDA, weather, supply chain, news)
- Struggling to separate signal from noise
- Missing critical market developments due to information overload

We built Macrovesta to solve this. It's an AI-powered platform that consolidates cotton market data and forecasts price movements using a simple 5-factor system.

Worth a 15-minute demo? Reply with your availability.

Best,
Joe / Macrovesta
www.macrovesta.ai

P.S. - Backed by 10+ years of Earlam & Partners consultancy expertise (we've advised the world's largest farms, mills, and retailers).
```

**When to Use:** Advisors who are time-strapped, operational focus

---

## EMAIL 5: Problem-Aware (Variant B: Competitive Edge)

**Subject:** Your competitors are getting cotton market alerts before you

**To:** [Cold advisor prospect]

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

Friday 3:30 PM: CFTC COT report drops.

Your competitors using Macrovesta get a WhatsApp alert in 30 seconds:
"Managed money short 62,004 contracts (up 8,000). Bearish signal."

You're still on page 1 of the PDF, manually pulling data.

By the time you finish your 3-hour analysis, they've already alerted their clients.

Macrovesta automates government report analysis (COT, USDA Export Sales, Cotton on Call, Crop Progress) and delivers plain-language insights to WhatsApp.

¬£150/month vs Bloomberg's ¬£24,000/year.

Want to see how it works? Book a demo: [Calendly Link]

Joe / Macrovesta

**When to Use:** Competitive advisors, those mentioning "falling behind" or "losing clients"

## EMAIL 6: Social Proof Follow-Up

**Subject:** How [Competitor Company] forecasts cotton prices

**To:** [Cold prospect who didn't respond to Email 4 or 5]

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

Following up on my note about Macrovesta.

Just wanted to share: we work with cotton advisors across 14 countries (including several in [Their Region]).

A cotton advisor in Greece recently told us:

"I appreciate the educational part of it, how you explain, in simple words and with examples, what is needed to truly understand the cotton market."

The platform combines decades of cotton industry data with machine learning to forecast market trends. Plus, it explains WHY it's making each recommendation (no "black box" AI).

Can I send over a 2-min video showing how it works?

Best,
Joe

P.S. - Here's our comparison guide if you're evaluating different platforms: [PDF Link: Macrovesta vs Bloomberg vs SpreadCharts]

## EMAIL 12: No-Show Follow-Up (+24 Hours, Question-Led)

**Subject:** Quick question about your Friday workflow

**To:** [Same no-show lead]

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

Following up on the demo you booked earlier this week.

Quick question: how much time does your team currently spend analyzing USDA and COT reports each week?

Most advisors we talk to say 8-10 hours. At ¬£50/hour, that's ¬£20,000-¬£26,000/year in time value.

Macrovesta costs ¬£1,800/year and gives you those hours back.

Here's what [Similar Advisor] said after trying it:

"I got my Friday back. That's worth way more than ¬£150/month."

Worth 15 minutes to see how it works for you?

Book a new demo: [Calendly Link]

Best,
Joe

P.S. - No credit card needed for trial. You'll get your first COT alert this Friday and can decide if it's worth it.

# PHASE 5: POST-DEMO (Attended, No Trial)

## EMAIL 14: Custom Report Example (+24 Hours)

**Subject:** Your custom Macrovesta report example, [Name]

**To:** [Lead who attended demo but didn't start trial]

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

Great talking with you yesterday! You mentioned you spend [X] hours/week analyzing cotton market reports.

I wanted to show you exactly what you would have received if you'd been using Macrovesta last Friday.

Here's the WhatsApp alert you would have gotten at 3:30 PM:

---
üìä **COT Report Analysis (Nov 1, 2025)**

Managed money increased their cotton short position by 8,000 contracts this week (now short 62,004 total). That's a bearish signal - large speculators are betting on lower prices.

Commercial hedgers backed off their long positions slightly (down 2,000 contracts). Not a strong conviction move, but aligns with managed money's bearish bet.

**Bottom line:** Watch for downward price pressure next week unless we see supportive news from USDA or China demand.

Forward to clients ‚Üí
---

That's it. No 3-hour analysis session. No manually pulling data from PDFs. Just 30 seconds to review and send to your clients.

If you want to get this alert THIS Friday, start your 14-day trial:
[Trial Link]

No credit card needed. First alert arrives Friday 3:30 PM.

Questions? Just reply to this email.

Best,
Joe / Macrovesta

P.S. - At [X] hours/week, you're spending ~[X*52] hours/year on analysis. That's [X*52/40] work weeks. Imagine getting that time back.
```

**Personalization:**
- Replace `[X]` with hours they mentioned in demo
- Replace example analysis with actual recent COT data

## EMAIL 15: Social Proof (+3 Days)

**Subject:** How other advisors are using Macrovesta

**To:** [Same lead]

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

Following up on our demo from earlier this week.

I wanted to share how a few cotton advisors similar to you are using Macrovesta:

**David T., Independent Advisor (Texas)**
"I was skeptical about AI analysis, but the first Friday convinced me. I forwarded the COT alert to my 15 clients, added 2 sentences of my own thoughts, and was done in 5 minutes. Used to take me 3 hours."

**Maria G., Cotton Ginner (Greece)**
"The educational part is what sold me. My clients actually understand what managed money positioning means now because I can explain it in simple terms - just like Macrovesta does."

**Common use case:**
1. Friday 3:30 PM: COT alert arrives via WhatsApp
2. Quick 30-second review: "Yep, that's accurate"
3. Forward to client WhatsApp group (or email)
4. Add your unique market perspective (2-3 sentences)
5. Done. Friday evening is yours.

You mentioned you spend [X] hours/week on this. These advisors got that time back.

## EMAIL 16: FAQ/Objection Handling (+7 Days)

**Subject:** Common questions about Macrovesta (answered)

**To:** [Same lead]

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

It's been a week since our demo. I haven't heard back, which usually means one of these questions is on your mind:

**"How do I know the AI analysis is accurate?"**
Fair question. Macrovesta is trained on 10+ years of expert analysis from Earlam & Partners consultants (not a generic ChatGPT plugin). Plus, we show you the underlying data so you can verify in 30 seconds. You're still the expert - we just do the data gathering.

**"I like doing my own analysis. Why would I use this?"**
We're not replacing your analysis - we're automating the tedious part. You still add your unique market insights. You're just not spending 3 hours copy-pasting data from PDFs anymore.

**"Is ¬£150/month worth it for my small shop?"**
You mentioned you spend [X] hours/week on reports. At even ¬£30/hour, that's ¬£[X*52*30/12]/month in time value. Macrovesta costs ¬£150. You save ¬£[calculated savings]/month minimum.

**"What if I don't like it?"**
Cancel anytime. No contract. We're confident you'll love it (90%+ of trial users convert), but there's zero risk to try.

Still on the fence? Start the 14-day trial and see for yourself: [Link]

Or if you have a specific question I didn't address, just reply to this email.

Best,
Joe / Macrovesta

P.S. - This Friday's COT report could be the first one you DON'T manually analyze. Up to you.

**Extended trial: 30 days instead of 14**
Use code: TAKE-YOUR-TIME

Plus, I'll personally onboard you (15-minute call to walk through your specific workflow).

Offer expires in 7 days: [Trial Link with Code Pre-Applied]

## EMAIL 24: Educational Follow-Up (+24 Hours)

**Subject:** How to read COT reports (without spending 3 hours)

**To:** [Same lead]

**Body:**
```
Hi,

You downloaded our comparison guide yesterday - hope it was helpful!

Quick question: do you currently analyze CFTC COT reports?

Most commodity advisors spend 2-3 hours every Friday pulling data from the PDF and figuring out what it means.

Here's a shortcut I've learned over 10+ years in cotton markets:

**Focus on 3 Things:**
1. Managed Money positioning (not commercial hedgers)
2. Week-over-week CHANGES (not absolute numbers)
3. Extremes (highest short in 6 months? Pay attention.)

Example from last Friday:
- Managed money: Short 62,004 contracts
- Change: UP 8,000 from prior week
- Context: Highest short position since June

**Translation:** Big speculators betting cotton prices fall. Bearish signal.

That analysis took me 5 minutes. It used to take 2 hours.

Now imagine getting that analysis delivered to WhatsApp in 30 seconds. That's what Macrovesta does.

Want to see how? Book a 15-minute demo: [Link]

## EMAIL 25: ROI Calculator (+48 Hours)

**Subject:** Calculate your market intelligence ROI

**To:** [Same lead]

**Body:**
```
Hi,

Following up on the COT analysis tips I sent yesterday.

I built a quick ROI calculator to help advisors figure out if their current market intelligence setup is costing them money:

**[Open ROI Calculator]** (2-minute tool)

It asks:
- How many hours/week do you spend analyzing reports?
- What's your hourly rate?
- What tools do you currently pay for?

Then it calculates your total annual cost (time + tools).

Most advisors are shocked when they see the number.

Example:
- 10 hours/week √ó ¬£50/hour √ó 52 weeks = ¬£26,000/year (time cost)
- Bloomberg: ¬£24,000/year (tool cost)
- **Total: ¬£50,000/year**

vs.

- Macrovesta: ¬£1,800/year (tool cost)
- 30 seconds/week √ó ¬£50/hour √ó 52 weeks = ¬£65/year (time cost)
- **Total: ¬£1,865/year**

Net savings: ¬£48,135/year

Worth checking your numbers? [Calculator Link]

It's been a week since you downloaded our comparison guide.

- What advisors say after using it

No signup required. Just watch and see if it makes sense for you.

If it does, book a live demo here: [Link]
Or start your free trial here: [Link]

If it doesn't, no worries - hopefully the video was still interesting!

Best,
Joe / Macrovesta

P.S. - This Friday at 3:30 PM, you could get your first automated COT alert. Or you could spend 3 hours manually analyzing like usual. Your choice.

Before Macrovesta:
- Spent 10 hours/week analyzing reports
- Friday evenings writing client summaries
- Missing family dinners
- Couldn't take on more clients (time-maxed)

After Macrovesta:
- 30 seconds/week reviewing WhatsApp alerts
- Friday evenings free
- Forwards alerts to clients instantly
- Took on 3 new clients (extra ¬£30K revenue/year)

His words:
"I was skeptical about AI replacing my analysis. Then I realized it's not replacing - it's just doing the tedious part. I still add my insights. I'm just not spending 3 hours pulling data from PDFs anymore."

**His results in Year 1:**
- Time saved: 480 hours (10 hrs/wk √ó 48 weeks)
- Revenue increase: ¬£30,000 (3 new clients)
- Cost: ¬£1,800 (Macrovesta subscription)
- **Net benefit: ¬£28,200 + 480 hours back**

If you're ready to get similar results, here's what to do next:

1. Start 14-day free trial: [Link]
2. Get your first alert this Friday
3. Forward to clients, see their reaction
4. Decide if it's worth ¬£150/month

Or if you want to talk first, book a demo: [Link]

Either way, hope this was helpful!

Best,
Joe / Macrovesta

P.S. - If Macrovesta isn't a fit but you know another advisor who'd benefit, feel free to forward this case study. Always happy to help the cotton community.
