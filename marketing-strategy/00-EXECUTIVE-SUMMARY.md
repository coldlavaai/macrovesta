# Macrovesta Go-To-Market Strategy
**Executive Summary for Client Presentation**
**Prepared by: Cold Lava for Macrovesta**
**Date:** October 28, 2025

---

## Overview

This document summarises the complete zero-to-sales marketing strategy for Macrovesta, designed to acquire 100+ paying customers within 6 months.

**Built on the 1-3-5® Planning Methodology:**
- **THE 1** = One crystal-clear vision of success for each phase
- **THE 3** = Three mission-critical objectives that enable the vision
- **THE 5** = Five action-oriented goals per objective (15 total actions per phase)

This framework is the **lifeblood of our entire strategy** - every phase, every campaign, every action is structured using 1-3-5 to ensure focused execution with measurable progress towards clear goals.

---

## Strategic Foundation

**Target Market:** Independent commodity advisors (PRIMARY) → Cotton traders (SECONDARY in Month 6+)

**Why Advisors First?**
- Weekly recurring pain (every Friday at 3:30 PM COT analysis)
- Value proof in 5 days (first Friday after signup)
- Built-in viral loop (forward alerts to clients)
- Network effects (advisors share tools, traders keep edges secret)

**Market Position:** "Middle market" between free tools (£0/year) and enterprise platforms (Bloomberg £24K/year)

**Price Point:** £150/month (£1,800/year) - affordable for solo/small advisory firms

---

## Core Value Proposition

**One-Liner:** "Turn your 10-hour Friday into a 30-second WhatsApp alert"

**The Friday Problem:**
- Thursday 11 AM: USDA Export Sales → 2-3 hours analysing
- Friday 3:30 PM: CFTC COT Report → 2-3 hours analysing
- Friday evening: Writing client summaries → 2 hours
- Weekend: Catching up on other reports → 2-3 hours
- **Total: 8-10 hours/week. Every. Single. Week.**

**The Macrovesta Solution:**
- WhatsApp alert: "Managed money short 62,004 contracts (up 8,000). Bearish signal."
- Forward to clients, add 2-3 sentences of your insights
- Done. 30 seconds vs 3 hours.

## 3-Phase Launch Plan

### PHASE 1: Quick Wins - Start Close to Home (Weeks 1-4)
**Goal:** 10-15 free trial signups, 3-5 convert to paying (6-8 total customers)
**Budget:** £0-500
**Strategy:** Validate product-market fit with Joe's warm network BEFORE spending on ads

**Starting Position:** 3 existing paying customers

**Joe's Unfair Advantages:**
1. **Liverpool Cotton Brokers email list** (existing audience receiving Friday reports - pre-qualified!)
2. **Decades of industry relationships** (business cards, LinkedIn, phone contacts)
3. **Industry credibility** (people will do him favours, share to their networks)

**Tactics (Week-by-Week):**
- **Week 1-2:** Liverpool Cotton Brokers email announcement + Joe's personal network (20-30 high-quality contacts)
- **Week 2-3:** Industry favour-asks (3-5 high-value relationships only)
- **Week 3-4:** Early adopter referral programme + LinkedIn organic (3 posts/week)

**Expected Results:**
- Liverpool Cotton Brokers list: 5-8 trial signups → 2-3 paying customers
- Personal network: 4-6 trial signups → 1-2 paying customers
- Favour-asks & referrals: 1-2 trial signups → 0-1 paying customers
- **Total: 10-15 trial signups → 3-5 new paying customers**
- **Total customers after Phase 1: 6-8**
- **£900-£1,200 MRR**
- **ROI: INFINITE (no ad spend, pure network leverage)**
- **Phase 1 is about learning and validation, not massive scale**

---

### PHASE 2: Scale with Paid Acquisition Testing (Weeks 5-12)
**Goal:** 25-35 total paying customers (17-27 new customers)
**Budget:** £1,500-3,000/month
**Strategy:** Test paid acquisition channels, build content foundation, prove paid ads can work

**Starting Position:** 6-8 customers after Phase 1

**Tactics:**
- Google Search Ads (£1,000-1,200/month) - High-intent keywords, testing and learning
- LinkedIn Ads (£700-1,000/month) - Job title targeting
- Content marketing (9 blog posts over 8 weeks) - SEO foundation
- Lead magnets (Comparison Guide, ROI Calculator, 2026 Outlook)
- Email nurture sequences (automated)

**Expected Results:**
- Google Ads: 10-15 new paying customers at <£250 CAC
- LinkedIn Ads: 5-10 new paying customers at <£300 CAC
- Content marketing: 2-5 organic customers
- **Total: 25-35 paying customers**
- **£3,750-£5,250 MRR**
- **Phase 2 proves paid acquisition can work at acceptable CAC**

---

### PHASE 3: Optimise and Expand (Month 4-6)
**Goal:** 50-75 total paying customers (25-40 new customers)
**Budget:** £3,000-5,000/month
**Strategy:** Optimise funnels, establish partnerships, validate trader market

**Starting Position:** 25-35 customers after Phase 2

**Tactics:**
- Scale paid ads with learnings from Phase 2 (Google + LinkedIn)
- Quiz funnel (personalised lead qualification) - prove it works
- Webinars (educate at scale, 1-2 webinars/month)
- Industry partnerships (Cotton Outlook, trade associations) - 2-3 partnerships
- Trader market testing (different messaging, dedicated landing page)

**Expected Results:**
- Advanced funnels: 10-15 customers
- Partnerships: 5-10 customers
- Trader market: 5-10 customers
- Scaled ads: 10-15 customers
- **Total: 50-75 paying customers**
- **£7,500-£11,250 MRR**
- **<£200 average CAC**
- **<15% churn**
- **Phase 3 proves systems work and sets foundation for scaling in Year 2**

---

## Channel Priority

### Tier 1 (START HERE):
1. **LinkedIn Organic** - Joe posts 3x/week, engages daily (FREE)
2. **Google Search Ads** - Intent-based keywords (£800-1,200/month)
3. **Warm Outreach** - Joe's network (FREE)
4. **Industry Publications** - Guest articles, sponsorships (£500-2,000/month)

### Tier 2 (PHASE 2-3):
5. **LinkedIn Ads** - Job title targeting (£700-1,000/month)
6. **Conferences** - ICAC, National Cotton Council (£2,000-5,000/event)
7. **Display Remarketing** - Only for website visitors (£200-500/month)

### Tier 3 (SKIP):
- ❌ **Meta (Facebook/Instagram)** - Wrong audience, wrong context
- ❌ **TikTok** - Not where 50-year-old advisors are
- ❌ **Generic podcasts** - Low ROI

**Why No Meta:**
- Commodity advisors use Facebook for personal life, not work
- B2B SaaS doesn't convert on consumer platforms
- £150-500 CPL (vs £40-80 on LinkedIn)

## Key Messaging Pillars

### 1. Time Savings (Rational)
"10 hours/week → 30 seconds"
"Get your Fridays back"

### 2. Professional Credibility (Emotional)

"Backed by 10 years of Earlam & Partners expertise"

### 3. Competitive Edge (Fear/Urgency)
"Your competitors get COT alerts in 30 seconds"
"Never miss a market-moving signal"

### 4. Affordability (Price Positioning)
"£1,800/year vs Bloomberg's £24,000/year"
"Less than £6/day to automate your workflow"

### 5. Workflow Automation (Unique Differentiator)
"We don't just give you data - we do the analysis FOR you"
"Plain-language WhatsApp alerts, not raw numbers"

## Why This Strategy Will Work

**1. Clear, Validated Target Market**
- Research shows advisors convert better than traders (weekly pain, fast value proof)
- ICP is narrow and reachable (LinkedIn, industry publications, conferences)

**2. Compelling Value Proposition**
- "10-hour Friday → 30 seconds" is visceral and measurable
- £24K savings/year ROI is undeniable
- Social proof from Earlam & Partners adds credibility

**3. Right Channels for B2B Niche**
- LinkedIn (where advisors network)
- Google Search (when they're actively looking)
- Industry publications (where they already read)
- NOT Meta/Instagram (wrong audience, wrong context)

**4. Phased Approach Reduces Risk**
- Phase 1 proves messaging with minimal budget
- Phase 2 scales what works
- Phase 3 optimises and expands
- Each phase has clear go/no-go criteria

**5. Automation Maximizes Conversion**
- 27 email templates cover every scenario
- DBR sequences recover 20-30% of lost leads
- Multi-touch approach (email + SMS + LinkedIn) increases conversion

## Investment vs. Return

**Total First 6-Month Marketing Investment:**
- Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): £500
- Phase 2 (Weeks 5-12): £12,000-18,000 (£1,500-2,250/month × 8 weeks)
- Phase 3 (Months 4-6): £9,000-15,000 (£3,000-5,000/month × 3 months)
- **Total 6-Month Investment: £21,500-33,500**

**Projected 6-Month Revenue Progression:**
- Month 1 (end of Phase 1): 6-8 customers × £150/month = £900-1,200 MRR
- Month 3 (mid-Phase 2): 15-20 customers × £150/month = £2,250-3,000 MRR
- Month 4 (end of Phase 2): 25-35 customers × £150/month = £3,750-5,250 MRR
- Month 6 (end of Phase 3): 50-75 customers × £150/month = £7,500-11,250 MRR
- **Total First 6 Months Revenue: £60,000-90,000 (cumulative)**

**Projected First-Year Results (if growth continues):**
- Month 12: 100-125 customers × £150/month = £15,000-18,750 MRR
- **Total Year 1 Revenue: £120,000-150,000**

**Conservative ROI Calculation (6 months):**
- Revenue: £60,000-90,000
- Investment: £21,500-33,500
- **ROI: 180-270%**

**Key Point:** This is a realistic, achievable progression that prioritises learning and validation over unrealistic growth targets.

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk 1: Low conversion rates**
**Mitigation:** Phase 1 validates messaging before scaling budget

**Risk 2: High CAC**
**Mitigation:** Multiple channels tested, focus budget on best performers

**Risk 3: High churn**
**Mitigation:** Weekly value delivery (Friday alerts), hard to churn once habituated

**Risk 4: Competitor response**
**Mitigation:** Move fast to 100 customers, build switching costs, first-mover advantage in advisor niche

---

## Conclusion

Macrovesta has a genuine market opportunity in the underserved "middle market" between free tools and enterprise platforms. Commodity advisors are drowning in manual analysis, and no one else is automating the complete workflow at an affordable price.

This strategy provides a clear path from zero to 100+ customers in 6 months by:
1. Targeting the RIGHT audience (advisors, not traders)
2. Using the RIGHT channels (LinkedIn/Google, not Meta)
3. Delivering the RIGHT message ("Get your Friday back")
4. Following the RIGHT process (Phase 1 → 2 → 3)

**The market is ready. The product is ready. Let's execute.**
