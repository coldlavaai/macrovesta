**Version 1.0 - October 28, 2025**
**Prepared by: Cold Lava for Macrovesta**

---

## Overview

**Target Audience:** Independent commodity advisors, cotton brokers, cotton traders
**Key Pain Points:**
- Spending 8-10 hours/week on manual report analysis
- Friday COT analysis grind (3:30 PM every week)
- Missing family/weekend time due to work
- High cost of enterprise tools (Bloomberg at £24K/year)

**Value Propositions:**
- Time savings (10 hours → 30 seconds per week)
- Cost savings (£1,800/year vs £24K Bloomberg)
- Work-life balance (get your Friday back)
- Professional credibility (faster, more accurate client updates)

**Distribution Channels:**
- LinkedIn Ads (PRIMARY - where advisors spend time professionally)
- Google Video Ads (YouTube pre-roll, search)
- Retargeting (website visitors, email list)

---

## CONCEPT 1: "The Friday Problem" (30 seconds)

**Hook:** Pain-first, emotional storytelling
**Style:** Split-screen animation (manual vs automated)
**Platform:** LinkedIn Ads, YouTube Pre-Roll
**Funnel Stage:** Awareness (Top of Funnel)

### Script

```
[Left Screen - Stressed advisor at desk, clock shows 3:30 PM Friday]
VO: "Friday 3:30 PM. COT report drops."

[Left: Papers flying, advisor manually typing, clock fast-forwarding to 6:30 PM]
VO: "3 hours of analysis. Again."

[Right Screen - Same advisor, relaxed, phone pings]
VO: "Or... 30 seconds."

[WhatsApp alert appears on phone: "Managed money short 62K contracts. Bearish signal."]
VO: "Macrovesta automates report analysis."

[Advisor forwards alert to clients, closes laptop, walks away]
VO: "Get your Friday back. Try free for 14 days."

[CTA: macrovesta.ai/friday]
```

### Visual Style

- **Design:** Clean, flat design (Dribble/Notion aesthetic)
- **Layout:** Split-screen (left = old way, right = new way)
- **Key Elements:**
  - Calendar animation showing Friday highlighted
  - WhatsApp UI mockup (familiar, trusted interface)
  - Clock fast-forward animation (3:30 → 6:30 PM)
  - Advisor character (professional but relatable)
- **Color Palette:**
  - Left (manual): Grey, blue (cold, stressful)
  - Right (automated): Green, white (fresh, easy)
- **Typography:** Modern sans-serif (Inter, Circular, or similar)

### Why It Works

- Addresses #1 pain point in messaging framework (Friday grind)
- Visual contrast (manual vs automated) creates powerful "before/after"
- Specific time-saving claim (3 hours → 30 seconds) - credible, concrete
- Emotional payoff (advisor walking away = work-life balance achieved)
- Friday timing (when pain is most fresh in their minds)

### Production Notes

- **Length:** 30 seconds (LinkedIn allows longer attention spans)
- **Voiceover:** British male, professional but warm (matches Joe's background)
- **Music:** Starts tense/stressful, shifts to relieved/upbeat at "Or... 30 seconds"
- **Aspect Ratios:**
  - 1:1 (square) for LinkedIn feed
  - 16:9 (landscape) for YouTube
  - 9:16 (vertical) for LinkedIn Stories

---

## CONCEPT 2: "The Cost Calculator" (20 seconds)

**Hook:** ROI-focused, data-driven
**Style:** Kinetic typography + animated numbers
**Platform:** Google Search Ads, LinkedIn Sponsored Video
**Funnel Stage:** Consideration (Middle of Funnel)

### Script

```
[Numbers appear, animated like a calculator]
VO: "10 hours per week analyzing reports."

[Animation: 10 × 52 = 520 hours]
VO: "That's 520 hours per year."

[Animation: £50/hour × 520 hours = £26,000]
VO: "Worth £26,000 in your time."

[Macrovesta logo appears, numbers flip]
VO: "Macrovesta: £1,800 per year."

[Animation: £26,000 → £1,800 with green check]
VO: "Save £24,200. And 520 hours."

[CTA: Calculate Your Savings → macrovesta.ai/roi]
```

### Visual Style

- **Design:** Minimal white background, focus on numbers
- **Typography:** Bold, modern sans-serif (60-80pt for main numbers)
- **Animation Style:** Numbers animate in like stock tickers or calculator displays
- **Color Coding:**
  - Red = cost (£26,000)
  - Green = savings (£1,800, £24,200)
  - Black = neutral calculations
- **Final Frame:** Side-by-side comparison table
  ```
  Manual Analysis:  £26,000/year
  Macrovesta:       £1,800/year
  You Save:         £24,200 ✓
  ```

### Why It Works

- Appeals to rational, ROI-focused decision-makers (CFO mindset)
- Clear math (no hyperbole, just facts)
- 14:1 return on investment (£24,200 saved on £1,800 spent)
- Short, punchy (20 seconds = perfect for pre-roll ads)
- Drives to ROI calculator (lead magnet = email capture)

### Production Notes

- **Length:** 20 seconds (skippable after 5 on YouTube)
- **Voiceover:** Authoritative, confident (think financial services ads)
- **Music:** Subtle, modern (not cheesy)
- **Motion:** Fast-paced number reveals (keep energy high)

---

## CONCEPT 3: "The Alert" (15 seconds)

**Hook:** Product demo-first, show don't tell
**Style:** Screen recording animation (WhatsApp UI)
**Platform:** Instagram/Facebook Retargeting, LinkedIn InMail Video
**Funnel Stage:** Decision (Bottom of Funnel)

### Script

```
[Animation: Clock shows 3:30 PM Friday, phone vibrates]
VO: "Friday. 3:30 PM. COT report just dropped."

[WhatsApp notification appears, expands to show full message]
Text on Screen: "Managed money short 62,004 contracts (up 8,000). Bearish signal for cotton."

[Finger taps "Forward" button, message sent to "Client Group"]
VO: "Review. Forward. Done."

[Text on screen: "30 seconds vs 3 hours"]
VO: "Try Macrovesta free."

[CTA: macrovesta.ai/trial]
```

### Visual Style

- **Design:** Realistic phone mockup (iPhone 15 Pro in dark mode)
- **UI Elements:**
  - WhatsApp interface (exact branding, colors)
  - Notification animation (slide down from top)
  - Tap/swipe gestures (finger cursor or hand animation)
- **Key Frames:**
  1. Lock screen with notification
  2. Tap to open WhatsApp
  3. Read full message
  4. Tap "Forward" button
  5. Select "Client Group" contact
  6. Message sent (double check marks)
- **Time Counter:** Small clock in corner (3:30 PM → 3:31 PM = 1 minute total)

### Why It Works

- Shows actual product interface (builds trust, removes mystery)
- Demonstrates core workflow (alert → review → forward → done)
- 15 seconds = perfect for retargeting (short attention span, already aware)
- WhatsApp UI is universally recognized (familiar, trusted platform)
- No sales pitch (just show the product working)

### Production Notes

- **Length:** 15 seconds (maximum impact, minimum time)
- **Voiceover:** Minimal (let visual tell the story)
- **Sound Effects:** Phone vibration, WhatsApp notification sound, tap sounds
- **Animation:** Smooth, realistic UI transitions (60fps for premium feel)

---

## CONCEPT 4: "Bloomberg vs Macrovesta" (25 seconds)

**Hook:** Competitive positioning
**Style:** Side-by-side comparison animation
**Platform:** LinkedIn Ads (target users with "Bloomberg Terminal" in profile)
**Funnel Stage:** Consideration (Middle of Funnel - competitor comparison)

### Script

```
[Split screen: Bloomberg Terminal (left) vs Macrovesta (right)]
VO: "Bloomberg Terminal: £24,000 per year."

[Left: Raw data streams, complex charts, overwhelming interface]
VO: "Gives you data. You still spend 3 hours analyzing."

[Right: WhatsApp alert with plain-language insight]
VO: "Macrovesta: £1,800 per year. Gives you insights."

[Right: Advisor forwards alert in 30 seconds]
VO: "Done in 30 seconds."

[Both logos side-by-side, checkmarks appear]
Text: "Use both. Save £22K and 480 hours."

[CTA: See the difference → macrovesta.ai/vs-bloomberg]
```

### Visual Style

- **Design:** Dark, professional aesthetic (finance industry standard)
- **Bloomberg Side (Left):**
  - Intentionally complex (scrolling data, multiple charts)
  - Dark terminal background (authentic Bloomberg look)
  - Overwhelming (shows the problem)
- **Macrovesta Side (Right):**
  - Clean, simple, mobile-first
  - WhatsApp green accents
  - Clear, readable text
- **Final Frame:** Both logos with checkmarks (not vs, but complementary)

### Why It Works

- Targets advisors already using Bloomberg (warm, high-value audience)
- Positions Macrovesta as complementary, not replacement (reduces objections)
- Massive cost savings (£22K/year if using both vs Bloomberg alone + manual time)
- Acknowledges Bloomberg's value (builds credibility, not combative)
- Shows specific use case (Bloomberg for pricing, Macrovesta for report analysis)

### Production Notes

- **Length:** 25 seconds (enough time for comparison)
- **Voiceover:** Professional, neutral (not attacking Bloomberg)
- **Legal:** No actual Bloomberg screenshots (use mockup/inspired design)
- **Music:** Sophisticated, modern (finance industry vibe)

---

## CONCEPT 5: "The Weekend" (30 seconds)

**Hook:** Emotional, work-life balance
**Style:** Character animation (advisor's life before/after)
**Platform:** LinkedIn Video Ads, YouTube (broader awareness)
**Funnel Stage:** Awareness (Top of Funnel - emotional hook)

### Script

```
[Animation: Advisor at desk, sun setting through window]
VO: "It's Saturday. You're still analyzing Friday's reports."

[Family in background, kid knocking on door]
VO: "Your family misses you."

[Scene transition: Same advisor, phone pings Friday 3:30 PM]
VO: "What if Friday looked different?"

[WhatsApp alert, advisor smiles, closes laptop]
VO: "30 seconds. Not 3 hours."

[Weekend scenes: Advisor at park with kids, coffee with spouse, relaxing]
VO: "Get your weekends back. Get your life back."

[CTA: Start free trial → macrovesta.ai]
```

### Visual Style

- **Design:** Warm, human character design (Headspace/Calm app style)
- **Characters:**
  - Main: Advisor (professional but relatable)
  - Supporting: Family (spouse, 1-2 kids)
- **Color Palette Shift:**
  - **Before:** Cold blue, grey (Saturday work = sad)
  - **After:** Warm yellow, green (weekend freedom = happy)
- **Scenes:**
  1. Saturday home office (dark, isolated)
  2. Family knocking (emotional moment)
  3. Transition to Friday with Macrovesta
  4. Weekend montage (park, coffee, relaxing)
- **Music:** Starts melancholic piano, shifts to uplifting acoustic guitar

### Why It Works

- Appeals to emotion, not just logic (deeper psychological trigger)
- Addresses "hidden cost" from messaging framework (time with family)
- Humanizes the problem (not just "save time," but "live better")
- Universal relatability (work-life balance is everyone's struggle)
- Strong final CTA (free trial = low-risk entry point)

### Production Notes

- **Length:** 30 seconds (needs time for emotional arc)
- **Voiceover:** Empathetic, warm (almost like a friend talking)
- **Animation Style:** 2D character animation (not too cartoony, keep professional)
- **Emotional Beats:** Sad → hopeful → joyful (classic story arc)
