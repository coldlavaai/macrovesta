# Macrovesta Phase 1 Execution Plan (1-3-5 Framework)
**Weeks 1-4: "Start Close to Home, Then Expand"**
**Version 1.0 - October 28, 2025**
**Prepared by: Cold Lava for Macrovesta**

---

## The 1-3-5® Methodology Explained

This plan uses the 1-3-5® business planning framework:

- **THE 1** = One crystal-clear vision of success (written as if already achieved)
- **THE 3** = Three mission-critical objectives that enable the vision
- **THE 5** = Five action-oriented goals per objective (15 total actions)

This framework ensures focused execution with measurable progress towards our ultimate goal.

---

# THE 1: Our Phase 1 Vision (Ultimate Goal)

## "By the end of Week 4, we have 30+ paying Macrovesta customers generating £4,500+ monthly recurring revenue through Joe's warm network and industry relationships, with zero money spent on advertising."

**Success Metrics:**
- ✅ 30-50 paying customers
- ✅ £4,500-£7,500 MRR
- ✅ 10+ video testimonials collected
- ✅ 50%+ trial-to-paid conversion rate
- ✅ <15% churn in first month
- ✅ £0-500 total spend (no ad budget)
- ✅ 5+ industry influencers sharing Macrovesta to their networks

**Why This Matters:**
- Validates product-market fit before spending on ads
- Builds social proof (testimonials) for Phase 2 campaigns
- Creates referral momentum (customers bring more customers)
- Proves "Start Close to Home" strategy works
- Establishes baseline metrics for scaling

---

# THE 3: Mission-Critical Objectives

## Objective 1: "We have converted Liverpool Cotton Brokers email list into 15-20 paying customers"

**Why This Is Critical:**
Liverpool Cotton Brokers subscribers already receive Friday cotton market reports from Joe. They're pre-qualified, they trust Joe's expertise, and the value proposition is obvious: "You like the Friday report? Get the automated version that saves you 10 hours/week."

This is our highest-probability conversion source. One email can generate 15-20 customers immediately.

---

## Objective 2: "Joe's personal network has generated 10+ paying customers through direct relationship-based outreach"

**Why This Is Critical:**
Joe has decades of industry relationships: business cards, phone contacts, LinkedIn connections, past consulting clients, conference contacts. These people know Joe, respect his expertise, and will trial based on his personal recommendation alone.

This is zero-cost, high-trust acquisition. No ad spend needed.

---

## Objective 3: "Industry relationships have created viral momentum with 5-10+ customers from referrals and favour-asks"

**Why This Is Critical:**
Joe knows trade association leaders, publication editors, and industry influencers who can share Macrovesta to their networks. Each share reaches 500-5,000 people. This creates compounding network effects: customers refer customers, influencers amplify reach.

This builds early adopter referral loops that continue beyond Week 4.

```
Hi [Name],

Hope you're well! [Personal touch - reference last conversation, conference, shared connection]

Quick favour - can I get your opinion on something?

I've been building a tool that automates cotton market report analysis (COT, USDA,
Cotton on Call, etc.) and delivers plain-language insights to WhatsApp the moment
reports drop.

Example: Friday 3:30 PM when COT hits, instead of spending 3 hours analysing, you get:
"Managed money short 62,004 contracts (up 8,000). Bearish signal."

Here's the key: Macrovesta does 80% of the work (pulls reports, analyses data,
writes summaries). You do the final 20% (review, add your insights, forward to clients).

Saves about 10 hours/week for most advisors.

Would you be willing to try it for 2 weeks (free) and tell me what you think?
Your feedback would be invaluable.

Here's the trial link: [Trial URL]

Or if you want a quick demo first: [Calendly Link]

Either way, would love to hear your thoughts.

Best,
Joe

P.S. - If it's useful for you, I'm happy to extend the free trial to anyone on your team.
```

**Success Metrics:**
- 25-30 messages sent by end of Week 1
- 60-80% response rate (warm relationships)
- 15-20 demo bookings or trial signups
- 8-12 paying customers from Wave 1

---

### Action 2.3: Personal Outreach - Wave 2 (Medium Priority Contacts, Week 2)
**Owner:** Joe
**Deadline:** Week 2, Friday 5 PM
**Deliverable:** 25-30 personal messages sent to medium-priority contacts

**Same approach as Wave 1, but:**
- Slightly less personalisation (still mention connection: "We met at ICAC 2024")
- Lead with the problem: "How much time does your team spend analysing USDA and COT reports each week?"
- Include social proof from Wave 1: "I've had 10 advisors trial it this week - feedback has been great"

**Success Metrics:**
- 25-30 messages sent
- 40-60% response rate (medium relationships)
- 10-15 trial signups
- 5-8 paying customers from Wave 2

### Action 2.4: Demo Calls for Personal Network Contacts (Weeks 1-3, Ongoing)

**Min 5-8: "Here's how it works for all your reports"**
- Quick tour of WhatsApp alerts (COT, USDA, Cotton on Call)
- Show plain-language analysis vs raw data
- Emphasise "forward to clients" feature
- "You're not replacing your expertise - you're saving time on data gathering"

**Min 8-12: "Let's talk about your specific needs"**
- Address their objections
- "What would you do with 10 extra hours per week?"
- Build emotional connection (weekends, family time)

**Min 12-15: "Here's what happens next"**

- "You'll get alerts this Thursday/Friday - see how much time you save"

Hi [Name],

Hope you're doing well! [Personal connection reference - last meeting, collaboration, etc.]

Quick favour: I've built a new tool for cotton advisors (Macrovesta) that automates
the Friday report analysis grind - turns 10 hours of COT/USDA analysis into 30-second
WhatsApp alerts.

It's based on a simple principle: Macrovesta does 80% of the work (data gathering +
analysis). Advisors do the final 20% (review + add insights + forward to clients).
Saves 8-10 hours/week.

It's getting great early feedback from advisors who are sick of spending their
weekends analysing reports. 15+ customers in the first week.

Would you be willing to [SPECIFIC ASK]:
- [If publication editor:] Mention it in your next newsletter / Let me write a guest article
- [If LinkedIn influencer:] Share a post about it / Give me a quote for social proof
- [If trade association:] Share with your member list / Let me present at next meeting
- [If conference organiser:] Let me speak about it / Include in event materials

I'm offering free 14-day trials (no credit card) - here's the link: [Trial URL]

Happy to write the copy for you, or you can just forward this email. Either way
would be hugely helpful.

If you want to try it yourself first, let me know and I'll extend your trial to
30 days.

Really appreciate it,
Joe

P.S. - If this takes off, I'd love to have you as an advisor to the company. Your
feedback has always been invaluable.
```

**What to Offer:**
- Free extended trial (30 days instead of 14)
- Affiliate commission (10-20% recurring if they refer customers)

**Target Publications:**
1. **Cotton Outlook** - Weekly newsletter (highest reach)

**Article Angle (NOT sales pitch):**

**Title:** "The Hidden Cost of Manual Report Analysis: Why Cotton Advisors Are Burning Out on Fridays"

**Hook:** Most cotton advisors spend 8-10 hours per week analysing government reports. That's 480 hours per year - 12 full workweeks - doing work that could be automated.

**Body:**
- The Friday grind (COT at 3:30 PM, USDA Export Sales Thursday 11 AM)
- Time cost calculation (10 hours/week × £50/hour × 52 weeks = £26,000/year)
- Advisor burnout stories (weekends, family time lost)
- The 80-20 principle: Technology should do 80% of the heavy lifting (data gathering + analysis). Advisors should focus on the 20% that matters (insights + client relationships).
- Technology solutions emerging (mention Macrovesta as one example, not the only one)
- Call to action: "Reclaim your time. Try automation tools."

**Pitch Email:**

```
Subject: Guest article idea - "Why Cotton Advisors Are Burning Out on Fridays"

Hi [Editor Name],

Joe Earlam here from Earlam & Partners / Liverpool Cotton Brokers.

I've been in cotton commodities for 20+ years, and I'm seeing a troubling trend:
advisor burnout.

The culprit? Manual report analysis. Most advisors spend 8-10 hours/week (480
hours/year) manually analysing USDA, CFTC, and crop reports.

I'd love to write a guest article for [Publication] on this topic:

**Proposed Title:** "The Hidden Cost of Manual Report Analysis: Why Cotton Advisors
Are Burning Out"

**Angle:**
- The Friday grind (COT at 3:30 PM, etc.)
- Time and financial cost calculation
- Impact on work-life balance and advisor retention
- The 80-20 solution: Technology does 80% (data + analysis), advisors do 20% (insights)
- How younger advisors are approaching this differently

This is NOT a product pitch - it's thought leadership on a real industry problem.

I can deliver 800-1,200 words by [date].

Interested?

Best,
Joe Earlam
```

**Success Metrics:**
- 2-3 article pitches sent
- 1-2 articles accepted and published
- Each article reaches 5,000-20,000 readers
- 2-5% click-through → 100-1,000 clicks
- 20% trial signup → 20-200 trials from articles

# Go/No-Go Decision Point (End of Week 4)

## Go to Phase 2 If:
✅ 20+ paying customers
✅ £3,000+ MRR
✅ 5+ video testimonials collected
✅ Demo → Paid conversion >30%
✅ Churn <15% in first month
✅ Clear understanding of why customers bought (can replicate in ads)

**If YES to all:** Proceed to Phase 2 (paid acquisition). Budget: £1,500-3,000/month.

## Pause and Optimise If:
⚠️ <10 paying customers after 4 weeks
⚠️ Demo → Paid conversion <20%
⚠️ High churn (>30% in first month)
⚠️ Consistent objection you can't overcome
⚠️ Product issues causing trial drop-off

**If YES to any:** Fix messaging/product before spending money on ads. Extend Phase 1 by 2-4 weeks. Do not proceed to paid ads until fundamentals are solid.

---

# The 80-20 Principle (Core Messaging)

## Macrovesta Does 80% of the Work. You Do the Final 20%.

**The 80% (Macrovesta Handles):**
1. Monitoring report release times (USDA 11 AM Thursday, COT 3:30 PM Friday, etc.)
2. Pulling reports the moment they drop
3. Extracting key data points (managed money positions, export sales, crop progress)

# Key Talking Points for All Phase 1 Outreach

## The Friday Night Problem
"It's Friday 3:30 PM. COT report drops. You have dinner plans at 7 PM. You know you're about to spend the next 3 hours analysing data instead of spending time with family. Sound familiar?"

## The 80-20 Solution
"Macrovesta does 80% of the work - pulls reports, analyses data, writes summaries. You do 20% - review in 30 seconds, add your take, forward to clients. Done."

## The Time ROI
"10 hours/week saved × 52 weeks = 520 hours/year. That's 13 full workweeks. What would you do with an extra quarter of your year back?"

## The Cost ROI
"Most advisors spend £26,000/year in time on report analysis (10 hours/week × £50/hour). Macrovesta costs £1,800/year. Net savings: £24,200/year."

## The Credibility Angle
"Backed by 10+ years of Earlam & Partners consultancy. This isn't generic AI - it's trained on decades of expert cotton market analysis."

## The 'You're Still the Expert' Reassurance
"Your expertise is what clients pay for - we're not replacing that. We're saving you time on the boring data gathering so you can focus on insights and relationships."
