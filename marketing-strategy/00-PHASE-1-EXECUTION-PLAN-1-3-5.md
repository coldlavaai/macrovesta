# Macrovesta Phase 1 Execution Plan (1-3-5 Framework)
**Weeks 1-4: "Start Close to Home, Then Expand"**
**Version 1.0 - October 28, 2025**
**Prepared by: Cold Lava for Macrovesta**

---

## The 1-3-5® Methodology Explained

This plan uses the 1-3-5® business planning framework:

- **THE 1** = One crystal-clear vision of success (written as if already achieved)
- **THE 3** = Three mission-critical objectives that enable the vision
- **THE 5** = Five action-oriented goals per objective (15 total actions)

This framework ensures focused execution with measurable progress towards our ultimate goal.

---

# THE 1: Our Phase 1 Vision (Ultimate Goal)

## "By the end of Week 4, we have 10-15 advisors actively trialling Macrovesta, with 3-5 converting to paying customers (bringing us to 6-8 total paying customers), genuine user feedback guiding product improvements, and clear proof that the 'Friday night problem' messaging resonates."

**Success Metrics:**
- ✅ 10-15 active free trial signups
- ✅ 3-5 trial → paid conversions in Week 4
- ✅ 6-8 total paying customers (including existing 3)
- ✅ £900-£1,200 MRR (modest growth from current baseline)
- ✅ 3+ video testimonials collected (genuine user stories)
- ✅ 30-40% trial-to-paid conversion rate (realistic for new product)
- ✅ <20% churn in first month (learning from early feedback)
- ✅ £0-500 total spend (pure network leverage, no ad budget)
- ✅ Clear documentation of why people buy and why they don't (insight for Phase 2)

**Why This Matters:**
- **Validates product-market fit** before spending on paid ads
- **Builds genuine social proof** (testimonials, case studies) for Phase 2 campaigns
- **Gathers critical user feedback** to improve product before scaling
- **Proves "Start Close to Home" strategy** works with real numbers
- **Establishes baseline conversion metrics** for paid acquisition forecasting
- **Creates early referral momentum** (even 1-2 referrals proves viral loop)
- **Stress-tests onboarding** and customer support processes with manageable volume

---

# THE 3: Mission-Critical Objectives

## Objective 1: "Liverpool Cotton Brokers email list has generated 5-8 active trial signups, with 2-3 converting to paying customers"

**Why This Is Critical:**
Liverpool Cotton Brokers subscribers already receive Friday cotton market reports from Joe. They're pre-qualified, they trust Joe's expertise, and the value proposition is obvious: "You like the Friday report? Get the automated version that saves you 10 hours/week."

This is our highest-probability conversion source - warm audience who already value Joe's analysis. Even modest conversion rates (5-8 trials from 400-500 list) prove the concept works.

**Realistic Expectations:**
- Starting position: 3 paying customers
- Email list: 400-500 subscribers (warm but not all active)
- Expected trial signup rate: 1-2% (5-10 trials realistic)
- Expected trial → paid: 30-40% (2-3 paying customers)
- **Goal: 2-3 new paying customers from this source**

---

## Objective 2: "Joe's personal network has generated 4-6 trial signups through direct relationship-based outreach, with 1-2 converting to paying customers"

**Why This Is Critical:**
Joe has decades of industry relationships: business cards, phone contacts, LinkedIn connections, past consulting clients, conference contacts. These people know Joe, respect his expertise, and will trial based on his personal recommendation alone.

This is zero-cost, high-trust acquisition. Even reaching 20-30 contacts personally can generate 4-6 serious trial signups. Quality over quantity in Phase 1.

**Realistic Expectations:**
- Personal outreach: 20-30 high-quality contacts (not 100+)
- Expected response rate: 40-50% (warm relationships)
- Expected trial signup: 20-30% of responders (4-6 trials)
- Expected trial → paid: 30-40% (1-2 paying customers)
- **Goal: 1-2 new paying customers from this source**

---

## Objective 3: "Industry relationships have been activated for future growth, with 1-2 trial signups from early referrals and favour-asks"

**Why This Is Critical:**
Joe knows trade association leaders, publication editors, and industry influencers who can share Macrovesta to their networks. Phase 1 is about planting seeds - getting 1-2 favour-asks to say yes, publishing 1 guest article, activating the referral programme with early customers.

The goal isn't massive volume in Week 4 - it's building relationships and momentum that compound in Phases 2-3.

**Realistic Expectations:**
- This is the "plant seeds" objective, not "harvest crops"
- Focus on 3-5 high-value favour-asks (not 20+)
- Target: 1-2 yeses (which may not convert immediately)
- Launch referral programme (even 1-2 referrals in Week 4 proves the loop works)
- **Goal: Relationships activated + 0-1 paying customer from this source (bonus if it happens)**

---

### Action 2.2: Personal Outreach - Wave 1 (High Priority Contacts, Days 3-7)
**Owner:** Joe
**Deadline:** Week 1, Friday 5 PM
**Deliverable:** 10-15 personal messages sent to highest-priority contacts

**Channel Priority:**

4. **SMS** (if appropriate) - Immediate, high open rate

**Message Template (Personalised - NOT copy-paste):**

**Subject:** "Quick favour - I built something you might love"

```
Hi [Name],

Hope you're well! [Personal touch - reference last conversation, conference, shared connection]

Quick favour - can I get your opinion on something?

I've been building a tool that automates cotton market report analysis (COT, USDA,
Cotton on Call, etc.) and delivers plain-language insights to WhatsApp the moment
reports drop.

Example: Friday 3:30 PM when COT hits, instead of spending 3 hours analysing, you get:
"Managed money short 62,004 contracts (up 8,000). Bearish signal."

Here's the key: Macrovesta does 80% of the work (pulls reports, analyses data,
writes summaries). You do the final 20% (review, add your insights, forward to clients).

Saves about 10 hours/week for most advisors.

Would you be willing to try it for 2 weeks (free) and tell me what you think?
Your feedback would be invaluable.

Here's the trial link: [Trial URL]

Or if you want a quick demo first: [Calendly Link]

Either way, would love to hear your thoughts.

Best,
Joe

P.S. - If it's useful for you, I'm happy to extend the free trial to anyone on your team.
```

**Success Metrics:**
- 10-15 messages sent by end of Week 1
- 50-60% response rate (warm relationships, but realistic)
- 3-5 demo bookings or trial signups
- 1-2 paying customers from Wave 1 (converting in Week 2-4)

---

### Action 2.3: Personal Outreach - Wave 2 (Medium Priority Contacts, Week 2)
**Owner:** Joe
**Deadline:** Week 2, Friday 5 PM
**Deliverable:** 10-15 personal messages sent to medium-priority contacts

**Same approach as Wave 1, but:**
- Slightly less personalisation (still mention connection: "We met at ICAC 2024")
- Lead with the problem: "How much time does your team spend analysing USDA and COT reports each week?"
- Include social proof from Wave 1: "I've had 5 advisors trial it this week - feedback has been great"

**Success Metrics:**
- 10-15 messages sent
- 30-40% response rate (medium relationships)
- 2-3 trial signups
- 0-1 paying customers from Wave 2 (conversions may happen in Weeks 3-4)

- Show plain-language analysis vs raw data

**Min 8-12: "Let's talk about your specific needs"**

```
Hi [Name],

Hope you're doing well! [Personal connection reference - last meeting, collaboration, etc.]

Quick favour: I've built a new tool for cotton advisors (Macrovesta) that automates
the Friday report analysis grind - turns 10 hours of COT/USDA analysis into 30-second
WhatsApp alerts.

It's based on a simple principle: Macrovesta does 80% of the work (data gathering +
analysis). Advisors do the final 20% (review + add insights + forward to clients).
Saves 8-10 hours/week.

It's getting great early feedback from advisors who are sick of spending their
weekends analysing reports. 15+ customers in the first week.

Would you be willing to [SPECIFIC ASK]:
- [If publication editor:] Mention it in your next newsletter / Let me write a guest article
- [If LinkedIn influencer:] Share a post about it / Give me a quote for social proof
- [If trade association:] Share with your member list / Let me present at next meeting
- [If conference organiser:] Let me speak about it / Include in event materials

I'm offering free 14-day trials (no credit card) - here's the link: [Trial URL]

Happy to write the copy for you, or you can just forward this email. Either way
would be hugely helpful.

If you want to try it yourself first, let me know and I'll extend your trial to
30 days.

Really appreciate it,
Joe

P.S. - If this takes off, I'd love to have you as an advisor to the company. Your
feedback has always been invaluable.
```

**What to Offer:**
- Free extended trial (30 days instead of 14)
- Affiliate commission (10-20% recurring if they refer customers)
- "Advisor to Macrovesta" title (credibility for them)
- Co-marketing opportunities (joint webinar, case study)
- Speaking opportunity at future Macrovesta events

**Success Metrics:**
- 3-5 favour-asks sent (only to those Joe knows well)
- 1-2 yeses (realistic for even warm asks - people are busy)
- Each "yes" plants seeds for Phase 2-3 (may not convert immediately)
- Goal: Relationships activated, not immediate conversions

---

### Action 3.3: Guest Article Placements (Weeks 2-4)
**Owner:** Joe + Macrovesta Team (Cold Lava can help with writing)
**Deadline:** Week 2: Pitch sent. Week 4-6: Article published (if accepted).
**Deliverable:** 1 guest article pitch sent, ideally 1 published (but acceptance may take until Phase 2)

**Target Publications (pick ONE for Phase 1):**
1. **Cotton Outlook** - Weekly newsletter (if Joe has editor relationship)
2. **LinkedIn Pulse** - By Joe (easiest to publish, no gatekeepers)

**Article Angle (NOT sales pitch):**

**Title:** "The Hidden Cost of Manual Report Analysis: Why Cotton Advisors Are Burning Out on Fridays"

**Hook:** Most cotton advisors spend 8-10 hours per week analysing government reports. That's 480 hours per year - 12 full workweeks - doing work that could be automated.

**Body:**
- The Friday grind (COT at 3:30 PM, USDA Export Sales Thursday 11 AM)
- Time cost calculation (10 hours/week × £50/hour × 52 weeks = £26,000/year)
- Advisor burnout stories (weekends, family time lost)
- The 80-20 principle: Technology should do 80% of the heavy lifting (data gathering + analysis). Advisors should focus on the 20% that matters (insights + client relationships).
- Technology solutions emerging (mention Macrovesta as one example, not the only one)
- Call to action: "Reclaim your time. Try automation tools."

**Pitch Email:**

```
Subject: Guest article idea - "Why Cotton Advisors Are Burning Out on Fridays"

Hi [Editor Name],

Joe Earlam here from Earlam & Partners / Liverpool Cotton Brokers.

I've been in cotton commodities for 20+ years, and I'm seeing a troubling trend:
advisor burnout.

The culprit? Manual report analysis. Most advisors spend 8-10 hours/week (480
hours/year) manually analysing USDA, CFTC, and crop reports.

I'd love to write a guest article for [Publication] on this topic:

**Proposed Title:** "The Hidden Cost of Manual Report Analysis: Why Cotton Advisors
Are Burning Out"

**Angle:**
- The Friday grind (COT at 3:30 PM, etc.)
- Time and financial cost calculation
- Impact on work-life balance and advisor retention
- The 80-20 solution: Technology does 80% (data + analysis), advisors do 20% (insights)
- How younger advisors are approaching this differently

This is NOT a product pitch - it's thought leadership on a real industry problem.

I can deliver 800-1,200 words by [date].

Interested?

Best,
Joe Earlam
```

**Success Metrics:**
- 1 article pitch sent (Cotton Outlook if relationship exists, OR publish on LinkedIn Pulse)
- 1 article published by end of Week 4 (or early Phase 2 if external publication)
- LinkedIn Pulse article: 500-2,000 views realistic (if Joe's network shares)
- Goal: Thought leadership and seeds planted, not immediate conversions in Phase 1

# Go/No-Go Decision Point (End of Week 4)

## Go to Phase 2 If:
✅ 5+ total paying customers (up from 3 - shows growth is happening)
✅ £750+ MRR (proving people will pay)
✅ 2-3 video testimonials collected (genuine user stories)
✅ Trial → Paid conversion >25% (baseline proven)
✅ Churn <25% in first month (acceptable for learning phase)
✅ Clear understanding of why customers bought AND why they didn't (can improve messaging)
✅ Product working reliably (no major technical issues)

**If YES to most:** Proceed to Phase 2 (paid acquisition testing). Budget: £1,500-3,000/month.

---

## Pause and Optimise If:
⚠️ <5 total paying customers after 4 weeks (no growth from baseline of 3)
⚠️ Trial → Paid conversion <20% (something fundamentally wrong)
⚠️ High churn (>40% in first month - product-market fit issue)
⚠️ Consistent objection you can't overcome (pricing? value prop? competition?)
⚠️ Product issues causing trial drop-off (technical problems, confusing onboarding)
⚠️ Can't get even 10-15 people to try it for free (demand issue)

**If YES to any:** Fix messaging/product before spending money on ads. Extend Phase 1 by 2-4 weeks. Do not proceed to paid ads until fundamentals are solid.

**Phase 1 is about learning, not scale. It's OK to be slower than planned - better to get it right than to rush into paid ads with broken messaging.**

# The 80-20 Principle (Core Messaging)

## Macrovesta Does 80% of the Work. You Do the Final 20%.

**The 80% (Macrovesta Handles):**
1. Monitoring report release times (USDA 11 AM Thursday, COT 3:30 PM Friday, etc.)
2. Pulling reports the moment they drop
3. Extracting key data points (managed money positions, export sales, crop progress)
4. Analysing week-over-week changes and trends
5. Comparing to historical data for context
6. Writing plain-language summaries ("Bearish signal" not "Short position increased 8,000 contracts")
7. Delivering to WhatsApp instantly

**The 20% (You Handle):**
1. Review Macrovesta's analysis (30 seconds)
2. Add your unique market perspective
3. Forward to clients with 2-3 sentences of your insights
4. Done. Get your Friday back.

**This is the core value proposition. Use it everywhere:**
- Email subject lines: "We do 80% of the work. You do 20%."
- LinkedIn posts: "What if you only had to do 20% of the report analysis work?"
- Demo scripts: "Macrovesta handles 80% - the boring data gathering and number crunching. You focus on the 20% that matters - your expertise and client relationships."

# Key Talking Points for All Phase 1 Outreach

## The Friday Night Problem
"It's Friday 3:30 PM. COT report drops. You have dinner plans at 7 PM. You know you're about to spend the next 3 hours analysing data instead of spending time with family. Sound familiar?"

## The 80-20 Solution
"Macrovesta does 80% of the work - pulls reports, analyses data, writes summaries. You do 20% - review in 30 seconds, add your take, forward to clients. Done."

## The Time ROI
"10 hours/week saved × 52 weeks = 520 hours/year. That's 13 full workweeks. What would you do with an extra quarter of your year back?"

## The Cost ROI
"Most advisors spend £26,000/year in time on report analysis (10 hours/week × £50/hour). Macrovesta costs £1,800/year. Net savings: £24,200/year."

## The Credibility Angle
"Backed by 10+ years of Earlam & Partners consultancy. This isn't generic AI - it's trained on decades of expert cotton market analysis."

## The 'You're Still the Expert' Reassurance
"Your expertise is what clients pay for - we're not replacing that. We're saving you time on the boring data gathering so you can focus on insights and relationships."
