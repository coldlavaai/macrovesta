# Macrovesta Phase 3 Execution Plan (1-3-5 Framework)
**Month 4+: Optimise and Expand**
**Version 1.0 - October 28, 2025**
**Prepared by: Cold Lava for Macrovesta**

---

## The 1-3-5® Methodology

This plan uses the 1-3-5® business planning framework - the **lifeblood** of our strategy:

- **THE 1** = One crystal-clear vision of success (written as if already achieved)
- **THE 3** = Three mission-critical objectives that enable the vision
- **THE 5** = Five action-oriented goals per objective (15 total actions)

---

# THE 1: Our Phase 3 Vision (Ultimate Goal)

## "By the end of Month 6, we have 200+ paying Macrovesta customers generating £30,000+ monthly recurring revenue with advanced funnels (quiz + webinar) converting at 2x baseline rates, 5+ strategic industry partnerships generating recurring referrals, and successful trader market penetration delivering 30+ new customers from the secondary market."

**Success Metrics:**
- ✅ 200+ paying customers
- ✅ £30,000+ MRR
- ✅ Advanced funnels: 50+ customers from quiz + webinar
- ✅ Industry partnerships: 40+ customers from partner referrals
- ✅ Trader market: 30+ customers from trader-specific campaigns
- ✅ <10% churn rate
- ✅ <£150 overall CAC
- ✅ 2,000+ monthly organic website visitors
- ✅ 20+ video testimonials

**Why This Matters:**
- Proves advanced funnels work (quiz qualifies better, webinars scale demos)
- Establishes partnerships that compound (recurring referrals)
- Expands TAM with trader market (secondary revenue stream)
- Achieves sustainable growth engine (£30K MRR)
- Creates defensible moat (partnerships + content library)

---

# THE 3: Mission-Critical Objectives

## Objective 1: "Advanced funnels (quiz + webinar) have generated 50+ paying customers and are converting at 2x baseline demo-to-paid rates"

**Why This Is Critical:**
Phase 2 proved direct response works (ads → landing page → demo). But we left money on the table: unqualified demos waste time, cold traffic bounces without capturing emails.

Quiz funnels pre-qualify leads AND capture emails from non-buyers. Webinars scale demos 1-to-many (30 people per webinar vs 30 individual demos). Both increase conversion AND reduce CAC.

Success here means profitable acquisition at scale.

---

## Objective 2: "5+ strategic industry partnerships have generated 40+ paying customers through recurring referral programmes"

**Why This Is Critical:**
Paid ads are expensive. Partnerships are leverage - one integration or referral agreement can generate 10-100 customers over time with minimal ongoing cost.

Trade associations, data providers, accounting software, industry publications - these partners already have our target audience's trust. A referral from Cotton Outlook carries more weight than any ad.

Success here creates compounding growth (partners keep referring).

---

## Objective 3: "Trader market expansion has delivered 30+ paying customers through trader-specific messaging and campaigns"

**Why This Is Critical:**
We've proven product-market fit with advisors (PRIMARY market). Now expand TAM with traders (SECONDARY market). Traders have different pain points (risk reduction vs time savings) but same core problem (Friday reports).

Success here diversifies revenue, reduces dependence on advisor market, and opens path to larger trading firms (5-50 employees).

---

# THE 5: Action-Oriented Goals (Per Objective)

## OBJECTIVE 1: Advanced Funnels → 50+ Customers at 2x Baseline Conversion

### Action 1.1: Build and Launch Quiz Funnel (Month 4, Weeks 1-2)
**Owner:** Macrovesta Team (Cold Lava can support with Typeform/web build)
**Deadline:** End of Week 2, Month 4
**Deliverable:** Live quiz at macrovesta.ai/quiz

**Quiz Structure:** (6 questions with personalised results)

**Quiz Landing Page:**
```
Headline: "Which Cotton Market Intelligence Setup Is Right for You?"
Subheadline: "Take our 2-minute quiz to find out if Macrovesta is a fit (and get personalised recommendations)."

CTA: "Start Quiz"
```

**6 Quiz Questions:**
1. What's your role? (Advisor / Trader / Large ag business / Other)
2. How many hours per week analysing reports? (0-2 / 2-5 / 5-10 / 10+)
3. Which reports do you currently analyse? (COT / USDA / Cotton on Call / Crop Progress / None regularly)
4. What tools do you currently use? (Bloomberg / SpreadCharts / Manual / Other)
5. What's your biggest challenge? (Time / Cost / Accuracy / Keeping up-to-date)
6. If you could save 10 hours per week, what would you do with it? (More clients / Strategic analysis / Work-life balance / Grow business)

**Personalised Results Pages:**

**IF: Advisor + 10+ hours/week + Manual only:**
```
Your Result: "You're the Perfect Fit for Macrovesta"

Based on your answers:
✓ You're spending 10+ hours/week analysing reports
✓ You're doing this manually (no automation)
✓ You're an independent advisor (our core customer)

Here's what would change with Macrovesta:
- 10 hours/week → 30 seconds/week
- Friday analysis → WhatsApp alerts
- £26,000/year time cost → £1,800/year subscription

Book demo: [Calendly]
Start free trial: [Trial link]
```

**IF: Trader + 2-5 hours/week + Bloomberg user:**
```
Your Result: "You Might Benefit from Macrovesta (As a Complement to Bloomberg)"

Based on your answers:
- You already use Bloomberg (great for real-time data)
- But you still spend 2-5 hours/week analysing reports

Macrovesta could complement Bloomberg by automating government report interpretation.

Many traders use both:
- Bloomberg: Real-time pricing, execution
- Macrovesta: Automated COT/USDA analysis

Worth a quick demo? [Calendly]
```

**IF: Low hours + Already automated:**
```
Your Result: "You're Already Optimised!"

Based on your answers, you're not spending much time on report analysis - great!

If your needs change, we're here: [Trial link]

In the meantime, here's a free resource: [Lead magnet]

**Deadline:** Friday, Week 1, Month 4
**Deliverable:** Partnership target list with outreach priority

**Partnership Categories:**

**Category 1: Data Providers (High Priority)**
- **Target:** Cotton Outlook, AgFlow, Urner Barry
- **Why:** They provide raw data, we provide analysis - complementary not competitive
- **Proposal:** White-label partnership (they offer Macrovesta to their customers with co-branding) OR referral commission (20% recurring)

**Category 2: Trade Associations (High Priority)**
- **Target:** National Cotton Council, Cotton USA, ICAC
- **Why:** They have our exact audience as members

**Owner:** Joe (personal outreach)
**Deadline:** End of Week 4, Month 4

**Outreach Approach:**

**For Data Providers (Cotton Outlook, AgFlow):**
```
Subject: Partnership idea - Macrovesta + [Their Company]

Hi [Name],

Joe Earlam here from Macrovesta (backed by Earlam & Partners).

I've been thinking about how [Their Company] and Macrovesta could work together.

You provide excellent cotton market data. We automate the interpretation of that data for advisors.

Proposal: White-label partnership where [Their Company] customers get Macrovesta analysis with your branding (revenue share 70/30).

OR: Referral partnership - you send us advisors who need report automation, we send you advisors who need price data. 20% recurring commission.

Worth a 30-minute call to explore?

Best,
Joe
```

**For Trade Associations (National Cotton Council):**
```
Subject: Member benefit idea for National Cotton Council

Hi [Name],

Joe Earlam here from Earlam & Partners / Macrovesta.

I've been talking to many National Cotton Council members over the past few months, and I keep hearing the same complaint: "I spend every Friday analysing USDA and COT reports instead of spending time with my family."

We built Macrovesta to solve this - automates cotton market report analysis and delivers WhatsApp alerts in 30 seconds.

Proposal: National Cotton Council members get exclusive discount (£120/month vs £150 standard) + we sponsor your next conference + provide educational webinar on modern advisory tools.

Your members save time, you provide valuable member benefit, we get access to right audience.

Worth exploring?

Best,
Joe
```

📋 You're in a logistics meeting   📱 WhatsApp alert arrives
   COT report comes out               "Managed money short 62,004
                                       contracts. Bearish signal."

Hi [Name],

Hope you're well. [Personal connection reference]

Quick question: How often do you get caught off-guard by COT or USDA reports because you were in a meeting / dealing with logistics / away from desk when they dropped?

I built something for this: Macrovesta.

The moment CFTC COT or USDA Export Sales drops, you get a WhatsApp alert:
"Managed money short 62,004 contracts (up 8,000). Bearish signal."

Make hedging decisions instantly. Avoid getting caught wrong-footed.

One missed signal can cost £25K+. Macrovesta costs £150/month.

Worth trying free for 14 days?

Best,
Joe

**Case Study Structure:**

**Title:** "How [Cotton Ginner, Greece] Avoided a £30,000 Loss with One WhatsApp Alert"

**Section 1: The Setup**
- [Trader Name] was managing 2,000 bales of cotton
- Market was volatile (describe conditions)
- COT report due Friday 3:30 PM

**Section 2: The Alert**
- Friday 3:30 PM: Macrovesta alert arrived on WhatsApp
- "Managed money short 68,000 contracts (up 12,000 from last week). Strongly bearish signal."
- [Trader] read alert in meeting (30 seconds)
- Immediately instructed team to hedge position

**Section 3: The Outcome**
- Cotton prices dropped 6¢/lb over next week (as COT predicted)
- Without hedge: 2,000 bales × 500 lbs/bale × 6¢/lb = £30,000 loss
- With hedge (triggered by Macrovesta alert): Position protected
- **Net benefit: £30,000 saved**

**Section 4: The ROI**
- Macrovesta cost: £150/month = £1,800/year
- Benefit from one alert: £30,000 saved
- **ROI: 1,667%**
- [Trader quote]: "That one alert paid for 16 years of Macrovesta. It's a no-brainer."

**Promotion:**

## Sustainable Growth Achieved If:
✅ 180+ paying customers (aim: 200+, minimum: 180)
✅ £27,000+ MRR (aim: £30,000+, minimum: £27,000)
✅ Overall CAC <£150

✅ Advanced funnels converting at 2x baseline
✅ 3+ partnerships generating recurring referrals
✅ Trader market validated (30+ customers)
✅ 2,000+ monthly organic visitors
✅ 20+ video testimonials
✅ Clear path to £50K MRR in next 6 months

**If YES to most:** Continue optimising. Consider raising prices, expanding to other commodities (wheat, corn), hiring sales team, raising investment.

## Optimise Further If:
⚠️ <150 paying customers
⚠️ CAC >£200
⚠️ Churn >15%
⚠️ Partnerships not generating expected referrals
⚠️ Trader market not responding

**If YES to any:** Pause expansion. Focus on retention (reduce churn), optimise existing channels, double down on what's working, deprioritise what's not.
