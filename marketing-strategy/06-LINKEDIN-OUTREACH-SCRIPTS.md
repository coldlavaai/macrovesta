# CONNECTION REQUESTS (300 Characters Max)

## REQUEST 1: Problem-Focused (Time Savings)

**When to Use:** Advisors with "Commodity Advisor" or "Cotton Broker" in title

**Message:**
```
Hi [Name], I help cotton advisors cut report analysis time by 75%. Noticed you're in [Location] - we work with several advisors there who were spending 10+ hours/week on USDA/COT reports. Worth connecting to share what's working?
```

**Character Count:** 247/300

**Why It Works:**
- Specific benefit (75% time savings)
- Localization (advisors trust local connections)
- Social proof ("several advisors there")
- No sales pitch (just "share what's working")

---

## REQUEST 2: Curiosity-Driven (Question-Led)

**When to Use:** Advisors who post about cotton market analysis

**Message:**
```
Hi [Name], saw your recent post about [specific topic]. Quick question: how much time does your team spend analysing COT reports each week? I'm researching automation tools for advisors and would love your perspective.
```

**Character Count:** 236/300

**Why It Works:**
- Personalised (references their post)
- Disarms sales defense ("researching", not "selling")
- Flattering (asking for their expertise)
- Opens conversation naturally

---

## REQUEST 3: Peer Introduction (Mutual Connection)

**When to Use:** When you share a mutual connection with prospect

**Message:**
```
Hi [Name], I see we're both connected to [Mutual Connection]. I work with commodity advisors on automating market analysis. If you're spending Fridays analysing reports, we should chat - I'd love to share what's helping advisors save 8-10 hours/week.
```

**Character Count:** 280/300

**Why It Works:**
- Mutual connection = trust transfer
- Specific day (Friday) triggers recognition
- Specific time savings (8-10 hours)
- Soft CTA ("we should chat")

# INMAILS (1,900 Characters Max)

## INMAIL 1: Personalised Pain Point

**Subject:** Quick question about your Friday workflow

**Message:**
```
Hi [Name],

I came across your profile and saw you're a [Job Title] at [Company].

Quick question: how much time does your team spend analysing USDA and COT reports each week?

Most cotton advisors I talk to say 8-10 hours. At £50/hour, that's £20,000-26,000/year in time value.

We built Macrovesta to solve this. It's an AI-powered platform that automates government report analysis and delivers plain-language insights to WhatsApp.

Example: Friday at 3:30 PM when COT drops, instead of spending 3 hours manually analysing, you get:

"Managed money short 62,004 contracts (up 8,000 from last week). Bearish positioning for cotton."

Forward to clients, done.

£150/month vs Bloomberg's £24,000/year.

Worth 15 minutes to see how it works?

P.S. - Backed by 10+ years of Earlam & Partners consultancy expertise.
```

**Character Count:** ~890/1,900

**Why It Works:**
- Personalised opening (job title, company)
- Quantifies pain (£20-26K/year)
- Specific example (real COT data)
- Price comparison (£150 vs £24K)
- Two CTAs (demo or trial - choice reduces pressure)
- Social proof (Earlam & Partners)

## INMAIL 2: Social Proof Heavy

**Subject:** How David saved 480 hours this year

**Message:**
```
Hi [Name],

You don't know me, but we work with cotton advisors who had the same problem you probably face:

Spending every Friday analysing COT, USDA, and Cotton on Call reports instead of actually advising clients.

David T., an independent cotton advisor in Texas, was spending 10 hours/week on this.

After trying Macrovesta:
- Time spent: 30 seconds/week (reviewing WhatsApp alerts)
- Time saved: 480 hours in year 1
- Revenue increase: £30K (took on 3 new clients with saved time)
- Cost: £1,800/year subscription

His words:
"I was skeptical about AI. Then I realized it's not replacing my analysis - it's just doing the tedious part. I'm not spending 3 hours pulling data from PDFs anymore."

We also work with advisors in [Their Region/Country] - [Similar Advisor Name if you have one].

If you're interested in seeing how this works for your specific workflow, I'd be happy to show you:

Book 15-minute demo: [Calendly Link]

Or just start a free trial and get your first COT alert this Friday: [Trial Link]

Best,
Joe / Macrovesta

P.S. - Here's a comparison guide if you're evaluating different platforms: [PDF Link]
```

**Character Count:** ~1,150/1,900

**Why It Works:**
- Leads with relatable pain
- Concrete case study (David T.)
- Specific results (480 hours, £30K revenue, 3 clients)
- Direct quote (authentic voice)
- Local social proof (advisors in their region)
- Two CTAs + bonus resource

# FOLLOW-UP SEQUENCES (After Connection Accepted)

## FOLLOW-UP 1: Value-First (Educational)

**Send:** 2-4 hours after connection accepted

**Message:**
```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for connecting! Saw your profile and noticed you work in [specific area - cotton markets/commodity trading/etc.].

Quick question: do you currently analyse CFTC COT reports?

Most advisors spend 2-3 hours every Friday pulling data and figuring out what it means. Here's a shortcut I learned over 10 years in cotton markets:

**Focus on 3 things:**
1. Managed Money positioning (not commercial hedgers)
2. Week-over-week CHANGES (not absolute numbers)
3. Extremes (highest short in 6 months? Pay attention.)

Last Friday's example:
- Managed money: Short 62,004 contracts
- Change: UP 8,000 from prior week
- Context: Highest short position since June

**Translation:** Big speculators betting cotton falls. Bearish signal.

That took me 5 minutes to analyse. Used to take 2 hours.

Now imagine getting that delivered to WhatsApp in 30 seconds. That's what Macrovesta does.

Want to see how? I can show you in 15 minutes: [Calendly Link]

Or here's a comparison guide if you're evaluating tools: [PDF Link]

Either way, hope the COT tip was helpful!

Best,
Joe
```

**Why It Works:**
- Gives value first (free COT analysis tip)
- Shows expertise (10 years experience)
- Demonstrates product value (30 seconds vs 2 hours)
- Soft CTA (demo or guide, low pressure)
- "Either way" = no-pressure exit

---

## FOLLOW-UP 2: Question-Led Engagement

**Send:** 2-3 days after connection if no response to Follow-Up 1

**Message:**
```
Hi [Name],

Following up on my note about automating cotton report analysis.

Curious: what's your current process for staying on top of USDA and COT reports?

Most advisors I talk to are:
A) Spending 8-10 hours/week manually analysing
B) Subscribing to multiple expensive services (Bloomberg, etc.)
C) Missing reports due to time constraints
D) Some combination of the above

Which sounds closest to your situation?

I ask because Macrovesta solves different problems depending on your workflow:

- **If A:** We automate the analysis (10 hours → 30 seconds)
- **If B:** We replace multiple tools at fraction of cost (£1,800/year vs £24K+)
- **If C:** We alert you the moment reports drop (never miss one)

Either way, I'd love to understand your specific workflow and see if there's a fit.

15-minute call? [Calendly Link]

Best,
Joe / Macrovesta
```

**Why It Works:**
- Asks open-ended question (invites conversation)
- Multiple choice (easier to answer than open text)
- Shows you understand different situations
- Tailors value prop to their answer
- Consultative (not sales-y)

---

## FOLLOW-UP 3: Case Study Share

**Send:** 5-7 days after connection if no response to Follow-Up 2

**Message:**
```
Hi [Name],

I don't want to keep filling your inbox, but I thought you might find this case study interesting:

**David T. - Independent Cotton Advisor, Texas**

Before Macrovesta:
- 10 hours/week analysing reports
- Friday evenings writing summaries
- Time-maxed (couldn't take new clients)

After Macrovesta:
- 30 seconds/week reviewing WhatsApp alerts
- Forwards to clients instantly
- Took on 3 new clients (£30K extra revenue/year)

His quote:
"I was skeptical about AI. Then I realized it's not replacing my analysis - it's automating the tedious part. I'm still the expert - I'm just not spending 3 hours pulling data from PDFs anymore."

Full case study here: [Link to Case Study]

If you're dealing with similar time constraints, happy to show you how this works: [Calendly Link]

If not, no worries - hopefully the case study was still interesting!

Best,
Joe
```

**Why It Works:**
- "Don't want to keep filling inbox" = respectful
- Real case study (names, numbers, quotes)
- Shows results (time, revenue, clients)
- Direct quote adds authenticity
- Gives them out ("if not, no worries")

---

## FOLLOW-UP 4: Final Demo Invitation

**Send:** 10-14 days after connection if no response to Follow-Up 3

**Message:**
```
Hi [Name],

Last message from me (I promise).

It's been a couple weeks since we connected, and I haven't heard back - which tells me Macrovesta probably isn't a priority right now. Totally understand.

That said, if timing was the only issue (not fit), here's a final offer:

**Extended trial: 30 days instead of 14**
Use code: LINKEDIN30

Plus, I'll personally onboard you (15-min call to walk through your workflow).

Offer expires in 7 days: [Trial Link with Code]

And even if you don't try it, here's a free resource in case it's helpful:

**The Commodity Advisor's Friday Workflow Audit**
Download: [Link]

Best of luck this season,
Joe / Macrovesta

P.S. - If you know another cotton advisor drowning in Friday reports, feel free to forward this. Always happy to help the community.
```

**Why It Works:**
- "Last message" removes pressure
- Special offer creates urgency (7-day expiration)
- Personal onboarding = high-touch closer
- Free resource = value even if they don't buy
- Referral ask = network effects
- Graceful exit

# ENGAGEMENT SCRIPTS (Organic Relationship Building)

## ENGAGEMENT 1: Comment on Their Posts

**When:** They post about cotton markets, USDA reports, COT analysis, or industry news

**Comment Template:**
```
Great point about [specific thing they mentioned].

I'd add that [complementary insight that shows your expertise].

We're seeing similar patterns in [related data point].

Out of curiosity, how are you advising clients on [specific question related to their post]?
```

**Example:**
```
Great point about managed money positioning being a contrarian indicator recently.

I'd add that the week-over-week changes matter more than absolute numbers right now - we're seeing 8,000+ contract swings that signal volatility ahead.

We're seeing similar patterns in the USDA export sales data (35% uptick last week).

Out of curiosity, how are you advising clients on hedging given this mixed signal environment?
```

**Why It Works:**
- Shows expertise without sales pitch
- Adds value to conversation
- Asks thoughtful question (invites reply)
- Positions you as peer, not vendor

---

We've been tracking [related data] and seeing [interesting pattern].
```

**Example:**
```
Totally agree with your take on China demand being the wild card this season.

Have you found the delayed USDA reports frustrating as well? Seems like we're getting data 48 hours later than usual lately.

Worth a read if you're following [cotton markets/commodity trends/etc.]: [Link to their post]
```

```
David Thompson nailed it on COT positioning extremes.

Key takeaway: When managed money hits record shorts, we're usually within 2-3 weeks of a reversal.

This aligns with what we're seeing at Macrovesta - our AI flagged this as a 6-month extreme last Friday.

Worth a read if you're following cotton futures: [Link]
```

**Why It Works:**
- Gives them exposure (they'll appreciate it)
- Shows you're paying attention
- Positions your tool as confirmation (not competitor)
- Builds goodwill

# LINKEDIN POST TEMPLATES (Organic Visibility)

## POST TYPE 1: Educational (Monday)

**Template:**
```
How to Read CFTC COT Reports Without Getting Overwhelmed

Most cotton advisors I talk to spend 2-3 hours every Friday analysing COT data.

Here's the shortcut I use to cut that to 5 minutes:

1. Focus on Managed Money positioning (ignore commercial hedgers for now)
2. Look for week-over-week CHANGES (not absolute numbers)
3. Identify extremes (highest short position in 6 months? Pay attention.)

This week: Managed money short 62,004 contracts, UP 8,000 from last week.

That's a bearish signal - large speculators are betting cotton falls.

What are you seeing in the market this week?

#CottonMarket #CommodityTrading #COTReport
```

**Why It Works:**
- Addresses pain point (time spent on COT)
- Gives actionable tip (3-step process)
- Uses recent data (relevant)
- Asks question (drives comments)

---

## POST TYPE 2: Value Demonstration (Wednesday)

**Template:**
```
What I Learned From Last Thursday's USDA Export Sales Report

Net sales for upland cotton:

→ 156,900 bales (up 35% vs prior 4-week average)
→ Primary buyers: China, Turkey, Pakistan
→ Cancellations: Minimal (bullish sign)

My take: Strong demand signal, especially with China back in the market.

Worth watching: Will this pace continue, or is this a one-week spike?

Advisors: How are you interpreting this for your clients?

#USDA #CottonExports #MarketAnalysis
```

**Why It Works:**
- Shares real market data (value)
- Shows analysis (expertise)
- Asks industry peers (engagement)
- Not sales-y (pure content)

---

## POST TYPE 3: Behind-the-Scenes / Results (Friday)

**Template:**
```
Just got off a call with [Advisor Name], who signed up for Macrovesta this week.

His reaction when he got Friday's COT alert:

"Wait, that's it? I usually spend 3 hours on this."

Exactly. That's the point.

If you're still spending your Friday afternoons copy-pasting data from PDF reports, there's a better way.

DM me and I'll show you how 30 seconds replaces 3 hours.

#CommodityAdvisors #Automation #CottonMarket
```

**Why It Works:**
- Social proof (real customer)
- Relatable reaction (3 hours → 30 seconds)
- Soft CTA (DM me, not "buy now")
- Friday timing (when pain is fresh)

---

# OUTREACH BEST PRACTICES

## Timing:
- **Connection requests:** Tuesday-Thursday, 9 AM - 3 PM UK time (business hours)
- **Follow-up messages:** Wednesday morning (midweek, not Monday rush)

## Personalisation:
- Always use first name
- Reference their company/location
- Mention mutual connections if applicable
- Comment on recent posts if you can

## Response Handling:

**If they reply with interest:**
→ Move to Calendly booking immediately

**If they reply with objection:**
→ Use objection handling from messaging framework

**If they reply with "not now":**
→ "No problem! Mind if I check in again in 3 months?"

**If they don't reply:**
→ Follow sequence: Message 1 → +3 days → Message 2 → +5 days → Message 3 → +7 days → Message 4 (final)

## A/B Testing:

Test these variables:
- Subject lines (question vs statement)
- First sentence (pain vs benefit)
- CTA (demo vs trial)
- Length (short vs detailed)

Track which gets higher:
- Acceptance rate (connection requests)
- Reply rate (messages)
- Demo booking rate (ultimate goal)
