# Macrovesta n8n DBR Automation Workflows
**Database Reactivation & Lead Nurture Automation**
**Version 1.0 - October 28, 2025**
**Prepared by: Cold Lava for Macrovesta**

---

## Overview

This document provides complete node-by-node specifications for 3 n8n workflows that automate lead nurture and conversion for Macrovesta. These workflows handle:

1. **Demo No-Show Recovery** - Re-engage prospects who book but don't attend demos
2. **Demo Completed, No Purchase** - Nurture attendees who haven't started trials
3. **Website Visitor Nurture** - Convert researchers into demo bookings

---

## Technical Requirements

### n8n Setup:
- n8n Cloud (https://n8n.cloud) or self-hosted instance
- Version: 1.0+ (tested on latest)

### Integrations Needed:
- **Google Sheets** (lead tracking database)
- **Twilio** (SMS delivery)
- **SendGrid or Mailgun** (email delivery)
- **Calendly** (demo booking webhook)
- **Sanity CMS** (optional - for centralized lead data)
- **OpenAI** (optional - for AI-personalized messages)

### Rate Limiting:
- SMS: 1 message per minute (Twilio compliance)
- Email: No strict limit, but recommend 5-10/minute to avoid spam flags

---

## Node-by-Node Specification

### NODE 1: Calendly Webhook (Trigger)
**Type:** `Webhook` (n8n-nodes-base.webhook)
**HTTP Method:** POST
**Path:** `/webhook/calendly-no-show`
**Authentication:** None (Calendly sends signature for verification)

**Expected Payload:**
```json
{
  "event": "invitee.canceled",
  "payload": {
    "name": "John Smith",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "event_type_name": "15-Minute Macrovesta Demo",
    "scheduled_event": {
      "start_time": "2025-11-01T14:00:00Z"
    },
    "cancel_reason": "No-show" or "Rescheduled"
  }
}
```

**Output:**
- `$json.payload.name` â†’ Lead name
- `$json.payload.email` â†’ Lead email
- `$json.payload.event_type_name` â†’ Demo type
- `$json.payload.scheduled_event.start_time` â†’ Missed demo time

---

### NODE 2: Extract Lead Data
**Type:** `Set` (Edit Fields node)
**Purpose:** Normalize data for downstream nodes

**Fields to Set:**
```javascript
name: {{ $json.payload.name }}
email: {{ $json.payload.email }}
phone: {{ $json.payload.questions_and_answers.find(q => q.question === "Phone Number")?.answer || "" }}
company: {{ $json.payload.questions_and_answers.find(q => q.question === "Company Name")?.answer || "" }}
demo_time: {{ $json.payload.scheduled_event.start_time }}
status: NO_SHOW
timestamp: {{ $now.toISO() }}
```

**Output:**
Clean data object ready for database lookup and messaging

---

### NODE 3: Check Lead Exists in Google Sheets

---

### NODE 4: Wait 4 Hours
**Type:** `Wait` (n8n-nodes-base.wait)

**Why 4 Hours:**
- Demo was scheduled, they forgot
- 4 hours = still same day, top of mind
- Not too aggressive (1 hour feels pushy)

---

### NODE 5: Send Email 1 (Video Recap)

**From:** joe@macrovesta.ai
**To:** `{{ $json.email }}`
**Subject:** "Missed you today - here's what you would have seen"

**Email Body:**
```html
Hi {{ $json.name }},

I noticed you weren't able to make our demo earlier today at {{ $json.demo_time }}.

No worries - I know Fridays get hectic (especially if you spent the afternoon analyzing COT reports ðŸ˜Š).

I recorded a quick 3-minute walkthrough showing exactly what we would have covered:

[Video Link: Loom recording of standard demo]

Key highlights:
âœ“ How Macrovesta turns 10 hours of Friday analysis into 30 seconds
âœ“ Example: Last week's COT report analyzed in plain language
âœ“ How to forward alerts to clients (saves even more time)

If this looks interesting, you can:
1. Book another demo: [Calendly Link]
2. Just start the 14-day free trial: [Trial Link]

Either way, hope the video is helpful!

Best,
Joe

### NODE 10: Send Email 2 (Question-Led Re-Engagement)
**Type:** `SendGrid`
**Subject:** "Quick question about your Friday workflow"

**Email Body:**
```html
Hi {{ $json.name }},

Following up on the demo you booked earlier this week.

Quick question: how much time does your team currently spend analyzing USDA and COT reports each week?

Most advisors we talk to say 8-10 hours. At Â£50/hour, that's Â£20,000-Â£26,000/year in time value.

Macrovesta costs Â£1,800/year and gives you those hours back.

Here's what [Similar Advisor in Similar Location] said after trying it:

"I got my Friday back. That's worth way more than Â£150/month."

Worth 15 minutes to see how it works for you?

Book a new demo: [Calendly Link]
Or start free trial: [Trial Link]

Best,
Joe

P.S. - No credit card needed for trial. You'll get your first COT alert this Friday and can decide if it's worth it.
```

### NODE 11: Send SMS 2 (Direct Offer)
**Type:** `Twilio`

**SMS Body:**
```

**Type:** `Wait`
**Duration:** 48 hours

**Total Time Since No-Show:** 72 hours (3 days)

---

### NODE 14: Final Check
**Type:** `Google Sheets`
**Operation:** Lookup

**Subject:** "Last email about Macrovesta (+ free gift inside)"

**Email Body:**
```html
Hi {{ $json.name }},

## Node-by-Node Specification

### NODE 1: Calendly Webhook (Demo Completed)
**Type:** `Webhook`
**Event:** "invitee_no_show.created" (inverted - they DID show)
**Path:** `/webhook/calendly-demo-completed`

**Payload:**
```json
{
  "event": "invitee.created",
  "payload": {
    "status": "active",
    "name": "Sarah Johnson",
    "email": "sarah@cottonadvisors.com",
    "event_type_name": "15-Minute Macrovesta Demo",
    "scheduled_event": {
      "start_time": "2025-11-01T14:00:00Z"

Last_Touchpoint: Attended demo
```

---

### NODE 4: Wait 24 Hours
**Type:** `Wait`
**Duration:** 24 hours

**Why 24 Hours:**
- Give them time to start trial on their own
- Not too fast (feels pushy), not too slow (they forget)

---

### NODE 5: Check Trial Status
**Type:** `HTTP Request` or `Google Sheets Lookup`
**Purpose:** Did they start trial in last 24 hours?

**If Using Sanity/Database:**
```javascript
GET /api/check-trial-status?email={{ $json.email }}

Response:
{
  "trial_started": true/false,
  "trial_start_date": "2025-11-02T10:00:00Z" or null
}
```

**If Using Google Sheets:**
- Lookup email
- Check column "Trial_Started" = "YES" or "NO"

**IF Trial Started:**
â†’ END workflow (they converted!)

**IF Trial NOT Started:**
â†’ Continue to Email 1

---

### NODE 6: Generate Custom Report (Optional - AI)
**Type:** `OpenAI` (n8n-nodes-langchain.openAi)
**Purpose:** Create personalized example analysis for their specific use case

**Prompt:**
```
Generate a sample Macrovesta alert for this advisor:

Advisor: {{ $json.name }}
Company: {{ $json.company }}
Time spent on analysis: {{ $json.hours_per_week }} hours/week

Use last Friday's actual COT report data (you have access to):
- Managed money positioning: Short 62,004 contracts (up 8,000 from prior week)
- Commercial hedgers: Long 58,234 contracts (down 2,000)

Write a 2-3 sentence WhatsApp-style alert this advisor would receive. Plain language, actionable, professional but conversational.
```

**Output:**
```
"Sarah, managed money just increased their cotton short position by 8,000 contracts this week (now short 62,004 total). That's a bearish signal - big speculators betting on lower prices. Commercial hedgers are backing off longs too. Watch for downward pressure next week."
```

---

### NODE 7: Send Email 1 (Custom Report Example)
**Type:** `SendGrid`
**Subject:** "Your custom Macrovesta report example, {{ $json.name.split(' ')[0] }}"

**Email Body:**
```html
Hi {{ $json.name }},

Great talking with you yesterday! You mentioned you spend {{ $json.hours_per_week }} hours/week analyzing cotton market reports.

I wanted to show you exactly what you would have received if you'd been using Macrovesta last Friday.

Here's the WhatsApp alert you would have gotten at 3:30 PM:

---
ðŸ“Š COT Report Analysis (Nov 1, 2025)

{{ AI_GENERATED_CUSTOM_ANALYSIS }}

Forward to clients â†’
---

That's it. No 3-hour analysis session. No manually pulling data from PDFs. Just 30 seconds to review and send to your clients.

If you want to get this alert THIS Friday, start your 14-day trial:
[Trial Link]

No credit card needed. First alert arrives Friday 3:30 PM.

Questions? Just reply to this email.

Best,
Joe

P.S. - At {{ $json.hours_per_week }} hours/week, you're spending ~{{ $json.hours_per_week * 52 }} hours/year on analysis. That's {{ ($json.hours_per_week * 52 / 40).toFixed(0) }} work weeks. Imagine getting that time back.
```

**Personalization:**
- Uses their name
- References hours they mentioned in demo
- Calculates their specific time savings
- Custom AI-generated analysis

Hi {{ $json.name }},

Following up on our demo from earlier this week.

I wanted to share how a few cotton advisors similar to you are using Macrovesta:

**David T., Independent Advisor (Texas)**
"I was skeptical about AI analysis, but the first Friday convinced me. I forwarded the COT alert to my 15 clients, added 2 sentences of my own thoughts, and was done in 5 minutes. Used to take me 3 hours."

**Maria G., Cotton Broker (Greece)** [Your existing testimonial]
"The educational part is what sold me. My clients actually understand what managed money positioning means now because I can explain it in simple terms - just like Macrovesta does."

**Common use case:**
1. Friday 3:30 PM: COT alert arrives via WhatsApp
2. Quick 30-second review: "Yep, that's accurate"
3. Forward to client WhatsApp group (or email)
4. Add your unique market perspective (2-3 sentences)
5. Done. Friday evening is yours.

You mentioned you spend {{ $json.hours_per_week }} hours/week on this. These advisors got that time back.

### NODE 15: Send Email 3 (FAQ + Address Common Objections)
**Type:** `SendGrid`
**Subject:** "Common questions about Macrovesta (answered)"

**Email Body:**
```html
Hi {{ $json.name }},

It's been a week since our demo. I haven't heard back, which usually means one of these questions is on your mind:

**"How do I know the AI analysis is accurate?"**
Fair question. Macrovesta is trained on 10+ years of expert analysis from Earlam & Partners consultants (not a generic ChatGPT plugin). Plus, we show you the underlying data so you can verify in 30 seconds. You're still the expert - we just do the data gathering.

**"I like doing my own analysis. Why would I use this?"**
We're not replacing your analysis - we're automating the tedious part. You still add your unique market insights. You're just not spending 3 hours copy-pasting data from PDFs anymore.

**"Is Â£150/month worth it for my small shop?"**
You mentioned you spend {{ $json.hours_per_week }} hours/week on reports. At even Â£30/hour, that's {{ (($json.hours_per_week * 52 * 30) / 12).toFixed(0) }}Â£/month in time value. Macrovesta costs Â£150. You save {{ ((($json.hours_per_week * 52 * 30) / 12) - 150).toFixed(0) }}Â£/month minimum.

**"What if I don't like it?"**
Cancel anytime. No contract. We're confident you'll love it (90%+ of trial users convert), but there's zero risk to try.

Still on the fence? Start the 14-day trial and see for yourself: [Link]

Or if you have a specific question I didn't address, just reply to this email.

Best,
Joe

P.S. - This Friday's COT report could be the first one you DON'T manually analyze. Up to you.
```

**Why This Works:**
- Proactively addresses objections (they don't have to ask)
- Personalizes with their time data
- Calculates specific ROI for them
- Low-pressure (just reply if you have questions)

**Email Body:**
```html
Hi {{ $json.name }},

It's been 2 weeks since our demo, and I haven't heard back. I'm guessing Macrovesta isn't a priority right now - and that's totally fine.

This is my last email.

That said, if timing was the only issue (and not fit), here's a special offer:

**Extended trial: 30 days instead of 14**
Use code: TAKE-YOUR-TIME

Plus, I'll personally onboard you (15-minute call to walk through your specific workflow).

Offer expires in 7 days: [Trial Link with Code Pre-Applied]

And if it's genuinely not a fit, no worries. Here's a free resource in case it's helpful down the line:

**The Commodity Advisor's Friday Workflow Audit** (PDF checklist)
Download: [Link]

Best of luck this season,
Joe

P.S. - If you know another cotton advisor who's drowning in Friday reports, feel free to forward this. Always happy to help the community.
```

**Why This Works:**
- "Last email" removes pressure
- Special offer creates urgency (7-day expiration)
- Personal onboarding = high-touch closer for fence-sitters
- Free resource = value even if they don't buy
- Referral ask = network effects

### NODE 8: Send Email 1 (Educational - How to Interpret COT)
**Type:** `SendGrid`
**Subject:** "How to read COT reports (without spending 3 hours)"

**Email Body:**
```html
Hi,

You downloaded our comparison guide yesterday - hope it was helpful!

Quick question: do you currently analyze CFTC COT reports?

Most commodity advisors spend 2-3 hours every Friday pulling data from the PDF and figuring out what it means.

Here's a shortcut I've learned over 10+ years in cotton markets:

**Focus on 3 Things:**
1. Managed Money positioning (not commercial hedgers)
2. Week-over-week CHANGES (not absolute numbers)
3. Extremes (highest short in 6 months? Pay attention.)

Example from last Friday:
- Managed money: Short 62,004 contracts
- Change: UP 8,000 from prior week
- Context: Highest short position since June

**Translation:** Big speculators betting cotton prices fall. Bearish signal.

That analysis took me 5 minutes. It used to take 2 hours.

Now imagine getting that analysis delivered to WhatsApp in 30 seconds. That's what Macrovesta does.

Want to see how? Book a 15-minute demo: [Link]

Or just start the trial and get your first alert this Friday: [Link]

Best,
Joe

P.S. - Here's last Friday's actual COT report if you want to follow along: [PDF link]
```

**Why This Works:**
- Provides value (teaches them how to analyze faster manually)
- Shows expertise (10+ years experience)
- Demonstrates product value (30 seconds vs 2 hours)
- Soft CTA (book demo or trial, low pressure)

### NODE 12: Send Email 2 (Second Lead Magnet - ROI Calculator)
**Type:** `SendGrid`
**Subject:** "Calculate your market intelligence ROI"

**Email Body:**
```html
Hi,

Following up on the COT analysis tips I sent yesterday.

I built a quick ROI calculator to help advisors figure out if their current market intelligence setup is costing them money:

**[Open ROI Calculator]** (2-minute tool)

It asks:
- How many hours/week do you spend analyzing reports?
- What's your hourly rate?
- What tools do you currently pay for?

Then it calculates your total annual cost (time + tools).

Most advisors are shocked when they see the number.

Example:
- 10 hours/week Ã— Â£50/hour Ã— 52 weeks = Â£26,000/year (time cost)
- Bloomberg: Â£24,000/year (tool cost)
- **Total: Â£50,000/year**

vs.

- Macrovesta: Â£1,800/year (tool cost)
- 30 seconds/week Ã— Â£50/hour Ã— 52 weeks = Â£65/year (time cost)
- **Total: Â£1,865/year**

Net savings: Â£48,135/year

Worth checking your numbers? [Calculator Link]

Hi,

It's been a week since you downloaded our comparison guide.

I figured instead of me telling you how Macrovesta works, I'd just SHOW you.

**[Watch 2-Minute Demo Video]**

In the video, I walk through:
- What Friday 3:30 PM looks like now (3-hour manual analysis)
- What it looks like with Macrovesta (30-second WhatsApp alert)
- How to forward alerts to clients (5 minutes total)
- What advisors say after using it

No signup required. Just watch and see if it makes sense for you.

If it does, book a live demo here: [Link]
Or start your free trial here: [Link]

If it doesn't, no worries - hopefully the video was still interesting!

Best,
Joe

P.S. - This Friday at 3:30 PM, you could get your first automated COT alert. Or you could spend 3 hours manually analyzing like usual. Your choice.

### NODE 18: Send Email 4 (Case Study - Final Touch)
**Type:** `SendGrid`
**Subject:** "How David saved 480 hours in his first year"

**Email Body:**
```html
Hi,

Last email from me (I promise).

I wanted to share a quick case study about an advisor similar to you:

**David T. - Independent Cotton Advisor, Texas**

Before Macrovesta:
- Spent 10 hours/week analyzing reports
- Friday evenings writing client summaries
- Missing family dinners
- Couldn't take on more clients (time-maxed)

After Macrovesta:
- 30 seconds/week reviewing WhatsApp alerts
- Friday evenings free
- Forwards alerts to clients instantly
- Took on 3 new clients (extra Â£30K revenue/year)

His words:
"I was skeptical about AI replacing my analysis. Then I realized it's not replacing - it's just doing the tedious part. I still add my insights. I'm just not spending 3 hours pulling data from PDFs anymore."

**His results in Year 1:**
- Time saved: 480 hours (10 hrs/wk Ã— 48 weeks)
- Revenue increase: Â£30,000 (3 new clients)
- Cost: Â£1,800 (Macrovesta subscription)
- **Net benefit: Â£28,200 + 480 hours back**

If you're ready to get similar results, here's what to do next:

1. Start 14-day free trial: [Link]
2. Get your first alert this Friday
3. Forward to clients, see their reaction
4. Decide if it's worth Â£150/month

Or if you want to talk first, book a demo: [Link]

Either way, hope this was helpful!

Best,
Joe

P.S. - If Macrovesta isn't a fit but you know another advisor who'd benefit, feel free to forward this case study. Always happy to help the cotton community.
