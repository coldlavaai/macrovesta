# Cold Lava: Phase 1 Hybrid Execution Plan (1-3-5 Framework)
**Next 2 Weeks: November 28 - November 10, 2025**
**Execution Model:** Hybrid (We execute scale tasks, Joe handles VIP relationships)
**Prepared by:** Oliver Tatler, Cold Lava

---

## The 1-3-5® Methodology

- **THE 1** = One crystal-clear vision of success (what's achieved by end of 2 weeks)
- **THE 3** = Three mission-critical objectives that enable the vision
- **THE 5** = Five action-oriented goals per objective (15 total actions)

---

# THE 1: Cold Lava's 2-Week Vision

## "By November 10, 2025, all Phase 1 infrastructure is live and tested, Liverpool Cotton Brokers email is drafted and approved, Joe's account access is secured, and Cold Lava is ready to execute Week 1 outreach the moment Joe gives the green light."

**Success Metrics:**
- ✅ Calendly demo booking system live and tested
- ✅ Trial signup flow live (Typeform → email notification)
- ✅ Google Sheet metrics tracker created and shared with Joe
- ✅ Liverpool Cotton Brokers email drafted and approved by Joe
- ✅ Email account access secured (Joe's Gmail/Outlook)
- ✅ LinkedIn account access secured (Joe's profile)
- ✅ Personal network contact list received from Joe (20-30 contacts)
- ✅ Week 1 execution plan confirmed with Joe
- ✅ Zero blockers preventing Monday, November 11 launch

**Why This Matters:**
- Can't execute on Joe's behalf without account access
- Can't send emails without approved templates
- Can't book demos without Calendly working
- Can't track progress without simple metrics dashboard
- **These 2 weeks determine whether Phase 1 launches on time**

---

# THE 3: Mission-Critical Objectives

## Objective 1: "Infrastructure is live and tested (Calendly, trial flow, tracking)"

**Why This Is Critical:**
Without working infrastructure, prospects can't book demos or sign up for trials. Even if outreach is perfect, broken booking flow = lost customers.

**Who Handles:** Cold Lava (100%)
**Target Completion:** November 3 (Week 1)

---

## Objective 2: "Joe's account access secured and templates are approved in his voice"

**Why This Is Critical:**
We can't send emails from Joe's account without login credentials. We can't post on LinkedIn without his account access. Templates must sound authentically like Joe, or people will know it's outsourced.

**Who Handles:** Cold Lava (setup) + Joe (approval, access)
**Target Completion:** November 7 (Week 2)

---

## Objective 3: "Week 1 execution plan is locked and everyone knows their role"

**Why This Is Critical:**
Clarity prevents confusion. Joe needs to know exactly which 5-10 VIP contacts he's handling personally. Cold Lava needs to know which 400+ Liverpool Cotton Brokers + 15-20 personal network contacts we're handling. No overlap, no confusion.

**Who Handles:** Cold Lava (planning) + Joe (approval)
**Target Completion:** November 10 (end of Week 2)

---

```
Subject: [Name], quick question

Hi [Name],

[Personal reference - "Great seeing you at ICAC last month" / "Hope the harvest went well"]

Quick question: How much time does your team spend each week analysing USDA and COT reports?

I ask because I've built something that might save you 10+ hours/week. It's called Macrovesta - automates cotton market report analysis and sends plain-language WhatsApp alerts the moment reports drop.

Example: Friday 3:30 PM when COT hits → "Managed money short 62,004 contracts (up 8,000). Bearish signal."

Would you be open to trying it free for 14 days? I'd love your feedback.

[Trial link] or [Demo link if you want to see it first]

Best,
Joe
```

**Template B: Past Client**
```
Subject: Built something you might love

Hi [Name],

Hope business is going well. Quick favor - can I get your opinion on something?

Remember how much time we used to spend analysing government reports when we worked together? I've finally automated the whole process.

Built a tool called Macrovesta that monitors USDA, COT, Cotton on Call, and Crop Progress - analyses everything with AI and sends WhatsApp alerts in plain language the moment reports drop.

Saves about 10 hours/week for most advisors. Would love to know what you think.

Free 14-day trial if you want to test it: [link]

Or book a quick demo: [Calendly link]

Either way, good to reconnect.

Best,
Joe
```

**Template C: Professional Acquaintance**
```
Subject: Cotton market intelligence tool

Hi [Name],

Joe Earlam here (we met at [event/mutual connection]).

I've built a tool for commodity advisors that automates cotton market report analysis - USDA, COT, Cotton on Call, Crop Progress.

Instead of spending hours manually analysing reports, you get instant WhatsApp alerts with plain-language insights: "Managed money short 62,004 contracts. Bearish signal."

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute demo? Or try it free for 14 days and let me know what you think.

[Demo link] | [Trial link]

Best,
Joe Earlam
Macrovesta / Earlam & Partners
```
