# Macrovesta Channel Priority Analysis
**Where Are Commodity Advisors Actually Looking for Solutions?**
**Version 1.0 - October 28, 2025**
**Prepared by: Cold Lava for Macrovesta**

---

## Critical Question: Where Is Our Market?

Commodity advisors are **NOT** your typical SaaS buyer. They're:
- 40-60 years old (experienced professionals)
- Old-school industry (cotton trading hasn't changed much in decades)
- Relationship-driven (trust industry connections over ads)
- Skeptical of "tech solutions" (they've seen tools fail before)
- Time-poor (won't browse social media for work tools)

**This changes everything about channel strategy.**

---

## Channel-by-Channel Reality Check

### ✅ TIER 1: High Probability Channels (Start Here)

#### 1. **LinkedIn (Organic + Paid)**
**Likelihood They're There:** 90%
**Why:** Professional networking is core to advisory business

**What They're Doing on LinkedIn:**
- Following industry news (Cotton Outlook, USDA updates)
- Connecting with other advisors (peer learning)
- Reading posts from thought leaders
- Job changes, company updates

**How to Reach Them:**
- **Organic:** Joe posts COT analysis every Friday (becomes known expert)
- **Paid:** Job title targeting ("Commodity Advisor", "Cotton Broker", "Agricultural Consultant")
- **Engagement:** Comment on industry posts, join groups

**Budget Priority:** HIGH
- **Organic:** 3-5 posts/week (free)
- **Paid:** £500-700/month (Phase 2)

**Search Behavior on LinkedIn:**
- NOT searching for tools directly
- But they'll click if they see: "How I got my Friday back" (curiosity)

**Why It Works:**
- They're already there for work
- Professional context (not personal social media)
- Peer testimonials carry weight ("David from Texas uses this")

---

#### 2. **Google Search Ads (Intent-Based)**
**Likelihood They're Searching:** 60-70%
**Why:** When they have a specific problem, they Google it

**What They Search For:**
- "how to analyse COT report faster"
- "USDA report analysis tool"
- "cotton market intelligence software"
- "commodity trading automation"
- "Bloomberg alternative for commodity advisors"

**What They DON'T Search For:**
- "cotton AI platform" (too generic)
- "machine learning commodity tool" (too technical)
- "SaaS for traders" (not how they think)

**How to Reach Them:**
- **Long-tail keywords:** "automate USDA export sales analysis"
- **Problem-based:** "reduce time spent on COT reports"
- **Competitor:** "Bloomberg alternative cotton"

**Budget Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH
- £800-1,200/month (Phase 2)
- Focus on 10-15 highly specific keywords
- NOT broad match - exact and phrase match only

**Why It Works:**
- High intent (they're actively searching for solution)
- Less competition (niche keywords = lower CPC)
- Direct problem → solution connection

---

#### 3. **Industry Publications (Direct Access)**
**Likelihood They're There:** 95%
**Why:** This is WHERE they work - reading Cotton Outlook, Cotlook, USDA reports

**Publications They Read:**
- **Cotton Outlook** (daily/weekly newsletter)
- **Cotlook** (price reporting service)
- **USDA Reports** (obviously)
- **National Cotton Council newsletters**
- **Regional trade association emails**

**How to Reach Them:**
- **Guest articles:** "The Future of Cotton Market Analysis" (not sales pitch)
- **Sponsored content:** "How 3 advisors automated their Friday workflow"
- **Banner ads:** (if publications offer)
- **Newsletter sponsorships:** "This issue sponsored by Macrovesta"

**Budget Priority:** MEDIUM
- Guest article: £0-500 (some publications free if you write it)
- Sponsored content: £500-2,000/month
- Newsletter sponsor: £300-1,000/month

**Why It Works:**
- They're ALREADY reading (captive audience)
- Trusted source (if Cotton Outlook recommends it, they pay attention)
- Context relevant (reading about cotton → see cotton tool)

---

#### 4. **Conferences & Trade Shows (Face-to-Face)**
**Likelihood They Attend:** 80%
**Why:** Industry networking is critical (clients, suppliers, peers)

**Events They Attend:**
- **ICAC (International Cotton Advisory Committee)** - Annual conference
- **National Cotton Council** - Annual meeting + regional events
- **Cotton USA events** (if US-based)
- **Regional cooperatives** - Local networking

**How to Reach Them:**
- **Booth:** Demo Macrovesta live ("See Friday's COT report analysed in 30 seconds")
- **Speaking slot:** "Panel on Modern Tools for Cotton Advisors"
- **Sponsorship:** Logo on badges, bags, conference app
- **Networking:** Joe attends, talks 1-on-1

**Budget Priority:** MEDIUM
- Booth: £2,000-5,000/event
- Sponsorship: £1,000-10,000/event (depending on tier)
- Speaking: £0 (actually adds credibility)

**Why It Works:**
- Trust built face-to-face
- Can do live demos (visual proof)
- Industry validation (if you're at ICAC, you're legit)
- Long sales cycle shortened (30-minute booth conversation vs 6-week email sequence)

---

### ⚠️ TIER 2: Medium Probability Channels (Test Carefully)

#### 5. **Google Display Network (Remarketing Only)**
**Likelihood They're Browsing:** 40%
**Why:** They use Google, but not actively browsing random websites

**What Works:**
- **Remarketing:** They visited macrovesta.ai → see ads on Bloomberg, Reuters, weather sites
- **NOT:** Cold display ads on random sites

**How to Reach Them:**
- Pixel website visitors
- Show ads on:
  - Cotton Outlook website
  - Bloomberg (if they visit)
  - AgWeb, Farm Futures (agricultural sites)
  - Weather.com (they check cotton-growing region weather)

**Budget Priority:** LOW
- £200-500/month (Phase 3 only)
- Only AFTER you have 1,000+ website visitors (need remarketing pool)

**Why It's Risky:**
- Low click-through rates (banner blindness)
- Expensive CPM for niche targeting
- Better to invest in search/LinkedIn

---

#### 6. **YouTube (Educational Content)**
**Likelihood They Watch:** 30-40%
**Why:** Some advisors watch industry content, but not primary channel

**What They Watch:**
- Cotton price analysis videos
- USDA report breakdowns
- Market commentary
- "How to" tutorials

**How to Reach Them:**
- **Create content:** "How to Analyse COT Reports in 5 Minutes"
- **Pre-roll ads:** On cotton industry videos (low volume)
- **Channel growth:** Slow, but builds authority

**Budget Priority:** LOW
- Organic content creation: £0 (Joe records videos)
- Paid ads: £200-500/month (Phase 3)

**Why It's Risky:**
- Low search volume for niche topics
- Time-intensive to build audience
- Advisors are readers, not watchers

---

### ❌ TIER 3: Low Probability Channels (Avoid)

#### 7. **Meta (Facebook/Instagram) Ads**
**Likelihood They're There for Work:** 5-10%
**Why:** B2C platform, NOT B2B professional services

**Reality Check:**
- Advisors use Facebook for personal (family photos, local news)
- They do NOT browse Facebook thinking about work tools
- Instagram is even less relevant (consumer products)

**Exceptions:**
- **Facebook Groups:** Some cotton trading groups exist, but:
  - Private (can't advertise in them)
  - Competitive (members don't share advantages)
  - Small (100-500 members max)

**Budget Priority:** ZERO
- £0/month
- Not worth testing

**Why It Fails:**
- Wrong context (personal vs professional)
- Wrong mindset (relaxing vs problem-solving)
- Wrong targeting (agriculture interest ≠ cotton advisor)

---

#### 8. **TikTok / Instagram Reels**
**Likelihood They're There:** 0%
**Why:** Come on. These are 50-year-old commodity advisors, not Gen Z.

**Budget Priority:** ZERO

---

#### 9. **Podcasts (Generic Business Podcasts)**
**Likelihood They Listen:** 10%
**Why:** They might listen to business podcasts, but not for work tool discovery

**Exceptions:**
- **Niche agricultural podcasts:** Worth exploring
- **Cotton-specific podcasts:** If they exist, sponsor them

**Budget Priority:** LOW
- Test 1-2 niche podcasts: £500-1,000/month (Phase 3)

---

### ✅ TIER 1.5: Unconventional High-Impact Channels

#### 10. **WhatsApp/Telegram Trading Groups (Indirect)**
**Likelihood They're There:** 90%+
**Why:** This is HOW commodity advisors communicate

**Reality:**
- Cotton advisors live in WhatsApp groups
- "Texas Cotton Advisors" group, "UK Cotton Traders" group, etc.
- They share market insights, tips, news

**How to Reach Them:**
- **You can't advertise directly** (private groups)
- **But you can get customers to share:**
  - Customer forwards Macrovesta alert in group
  - Someone asks: "What tool is this?"
  - Customer: "Macrovesta - saves me 10 hours/week"
  - **Viral effect**

**Strategy:**
- Make product SUPER shareable
- Encourage customers to forward alerts
- Add subtle branding: "Powered by Macrovesta" (tiny footer)

**Budget Priority:** £0 (built into product)

**Why It Works:**
- Peer recommendations > ads
- Trusted source (group member, not company)
- Immediate social proof (they see it working in real-time)

### Comparison (Capture Alternatives):
- "Bloomberg Terminal alternative" (1,000 searches/month, HIGH competition - hard to rank)

**SEO Content Plan:**

**Month 1-3: Educational Foundation**
1. "How to Analyse COT Reports Without Spending 3 Hours" (rank for: how to analyse COT reports)

- Month 3: 50-100 organic visitors/month
- Month 6: 200-500 organic visitors/month
- Month 12: 1,000-2,000 organic visitors/month

**SEO ROI:**
- Low immediate return (3-6 months to see traffic)
- High long-term return (compounds over time)
- Evergreen content (still ranking in 2027)

- Text overlay: "BEFORE" and "AFTER"

**Ad Copy:**
```

- 1.5% CTR on 7,800 impressions

---

## Meta (Facebook/Instagram) - Why NOT to Invest

**Targeting Issues:**
- Facebook: "Interested in Agriculture" = 50M people (farmers, students, hobbyists - NOT cotton advisors)
- "Job Title: Commodity Advisor" = Not enough data (Facebook doesn't know this)
- "Employer: Cotton trading firms" = Too broad, includes warehouse workers

**Context Issues:**
- People on Facebook are NOT in "work problem-solving mode"
- They're sharing family photos, watching videos, scrolling news
- Professional SaaS ads feel out of place

**Conversion Issues:**
- Even if you get clicks, quality is poor
- "Oh that's interesting" click ≠ "I need this for work" intent
- High bounce rate, low demo booking rate

**Cost Issues:**
- CPM (cost per 1,000 impressions): £10-20
- To reach 10,000 relevant people: £100-200
- CTR: 0.5-1% (lower than LinkedIn because wrong context)
- CPC: £3-5 (similar to LinkedIn)
- But conversion rate: 1-2% (WAY lower because low intent)
- CPL: £150-500 per demo (unacceptable)

**Verdict:** Don't waste money on Meta unless you have £10K/month to test and throw away.

## Final Recommendation: The 80/20 Channel Strategy

**80% of Results Will Come From:**

1. **LinkedIn (Organic)** - Joe posts 3x/week, engages with industry content
2. **Google Search Ads** - 10-15 high-intent keywords, £500-800/month
3. **Warm Outreach** - Joe's network, referrals from customers
4. **Industry Publications** - 1-2 guest articles, 1 sponsorship

**20% of Results Will Come From:**

5. Everything else (LinkedIn ads, conferences, remarketing, YouTube)

**What to IGNORE Completely:**

- Meta (Facebook/Instagram)
- TikTok
- Generic podcasts
- Display ads (except remarketing)
- Programmatic advertising

---

**Key Insight:** Commodity advisors are NOT online shoppers. They're relationship-driven professionals in a niche industry. You reach them through:
1. Trusted peers (LinkedIn, conferences)
2. Industry publications (Cotton Outlook)
3. Active problem-solving (Google search when they need a solution)

NOT through:
- Social media scrolling
- Random display ads
- Consumer-focused platforms
