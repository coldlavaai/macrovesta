# Macrovesta Lead Generation Playbook
**Zero to Traction: Phased Launch Strategy**
**Version 1.0 - October 28, 2025**
**Prepared by: Cold Lava for Macrovesta**

---

## Executive Summary

This playbook outlines a 3-phase approach to generate leads and sales for Macrovesta, starting from ZERO marketing infrastructure and building to a scalable acquisition engine.

**Target:** Independent commodity advisors (PRIMARY) → Traders (SECONDARY in Phase 3)

**Why Advisors First?**
- Weekly recurring pain (every Friday at 3:30 PM COT analysis)
- Value proof in 5 days (first Friday after signup)
- One-sentence pitch: "Automate your Friday workflow"
- Network effects (advisors share tools, traders keep edges secret)
- Built-in viral loop (forward alerts to clients)

**Phased Approach:**
- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4):** Quick wins using Joe's network, organic LinkedIn, warm outreach - £0-500 spend
- **Phase 2 (Weeks 5-12):** Scale with paid ads, content marketing, lead magnets - £1,500-3,000/month spend
- **Phase 3 (Month 4+):** Optimize with advanced funnels, partnerships, expand to traders - £3,000-5,000/month spend

---

# PHASE 1: QUICK WINS (Weeks 1-4)
**Goal:** 20-50 demos booked, 5-15 paying customers, validate messaging
**Budget:** £0-500 (mostly time investment)
**Success Metric:** 10+ conversations with real advisors, 5+ trial signups

---

## Phase 1 Overview: Start Close to Home, Then Expand

**Core Strategy: EXHAUST THE WARM NETWORK FIRST**

**Joe's Unfair Advantages:**
1. **Liverpool Cotton Brokers email list** - existing audience already receiving Friday/weekend reports (baby version of Macrovesta)
2. **Decades of industry relationships** - business cards, phone contacts, LinkedIn connections
3. **Industry credibility and respect** - people will take his call, do him favors
4. **Existing content distribution** - Liverpool Cotton Brokers reports go out weekly

**Why This Works:**
- B2B sales start with relationships
- First 10-20 customers are ALWAYS network/referrals
- Liverpool Cotton Brokers list is pre-qualified (they want cotton market analysis!)
- Free user research (learn objections, refine messaging)
- Build testimonials for Phase 2 paid campaigns
- People who respect Joe will trial based on his recommendation alone

**Phase 1 Priority:**
1. **Week 1-2:** Liverpool Cotton Brokers email list + Joe's personal network (business cards, phone, LinkedIn)
2. **Week 2-3:** Industry favor-asks (people with platforms who will share to their network)
3. **Week 3-4:** Early adopter referral asks + LinkedIn organic

**DO NOT spend money on ads until this network is exhausted.**

---

## WEEK 1-2: EXHAUST WARM NETWORK

### 1.1 Liverpool Cotton Brokers Email Announcement (PRIORITY #1)

**Audience:** Liverpool Cotton Brokers weekly report subscribers (existing warm list)

**Why This Is Your Biggest Asset:**
- These people ALREADY receive cotton market analysis from Joe
- They trust Joe's expertise (they're subscribed!)
- The value prop is obvious: "You like the Friday report? Get the automated version that saves you 10 hours/week"
- Zero cold outreach friction

**Email Template:**

```
Subject: I've automated our Friday reports (you're going to love this)

Hi [Name],

Joe from Liverpool Cotton Brokers here.

You know those Friday/weekend cotton market reports you get from us? The COT analysis, USDA export sales summaries, crop progress updates?

Well, I've spent the last year building something that automates the entire process - and I think you're going to love it.

It's called Macrovesta.

**Here's what it does:**

The moment USDA Export Sales, CFTC COT, Cotton on Call, or Crop Progress reports drop, Macrovesta:
1. Pulls the data
2. Analyzes it using AI (trained on our 10+ years of Earlam & Partners consultancy)
3. Sends you a plain-language WhatsApp alert: "Managed money short 62,004 contracts, up 8,000. Bearish signal."

Forward it to your clients. Add your insights. Done in 30 seconds.

**No more:**
- Waiting for the weekend report
- Spending 3 hours manually analyzing COT on Friday evening
- Copy-pasting data from PDFs
- Missing signals because you checked the report on Monday

**Why I'm emailing you first:**

You're already part of the Liverpool Cotton Brokers family. I wanted to offer you a free 14-day trial before we open this up to the wider market.

No credit card. No strings. Just connect WhatsApp and you'll get your first alert this Thursday when USDA Export Sales drops.

If you love it (I think you will), it's £150/month after the trial. If you don't, no worries - cancel anytime.

**[Start 14-Day Free Trial →]**

Or if you want to see it in action first: **[Book 15-Minute Demo →]**

I've been in this industry for decades, and this is the tool I wish I'd had 20 years ago.

Looking forward to hearing what you think,

Joe Earlam
Founder, Macrovesta
Liverpool Cotton Brokers / Earlam & Partners

P.S. - If you know other advisors or traders who'd benefit from this, feel free to forward this email. I'm happy to extend the free trial to anyone you refer.
```

**Timing:** Send Monday morning (so they can trial before Thursday/Friday reports)

**Expected Results:**
- Open rate: 40-60% (warm list, recognized sender)
- Click-through: 15-25% (clear value prop, existing trust)
- Trial signup: 10-20% of opens
- If list is 500 people → 200 opens → 30-40 trial signups
- 50% trial-to-paid conversion → **15-20 paying customers from ONE email**

**Follow-Up Sequence:**
- +3 days (Thursday AM): "Your first USDA Export Sales alert arrives in 3 hours - make sure WhatsApp is connected"
- +7 days (following Monday): "How was your first week? Save you some time on Friday?"
- +10 days (Thursday): "4 days left in your trial - any questions before you decide?"

---

### 1.2 Joe's Personal Network Outreach (Days 1-7)

**Goal:** 50-100 personal messages to advisors/traders Joe knows personally

**Source List:**
- Business cards (scan and digitize if needed)
- Phone contacts
- LinkedIn connections (filter for commodity/cotton/agriculture)
- Conference contacts
- Past consulting clients
- Industry association members

**Channel Priority:**
1. **Phone call** (if close relationship) - highest conversion, immediate feedback
2. **LinkedIn DM** (if connected) - personal, trackable
3. **Email** (if you have it) - scalable, copy-paste friendly
4. **SMS** (if appropriate) - immediate, high open rate

**Message Template (Personalized - NOT copy-paste):**

```
Subject: Quick favor - I built something you might love

Hi [Name],

Hope you're well! [Personal touch - reference last conversation, conference, etc.]

Quick favor - can I get your opinion on something?

I've been building a tool that automates cotton market report analysis (COT, USDA, Cotton on Call, etc.) and delivers plain-language insights to WhatsApp the moment reports drop.

Example: Friday 3:30 PM when COT hits, instead of spending 3 hours analyzing, you get:
"Managed money short 62,004 contracts (up 8,000). Bearish signal."

Saves about 10 hours/week for most advisors.

Would you be willing to try it for 2 weeks (free) and tell me what you think? Your feedback would be invaluable.

Here's the trial link: [Trial URL]

Or if you want a quick demo first: [Calendly Link]

Either way, would love to hear your thoughts.

Best,
Joe

P.S. - If it's useful for you, I'm happy to extend the free trial to anyone on your team.
```

**Why This Works:**
- "Quick favor" triggers reciprocity (Joe's helped many people in his career)
- "Get your opinion" is flattering, low-pressure
- Personal relationship = high trust
- Free trial = zero risk

**Expected Results:**
- Response rate: 60-80% (warm relationships)
- Demo booking: 30-40% of responses
- Trial signup: 40-50% of responses
- If Joe messages 50 people → 35 responses → 20 trial signups
- 50% trial-to-paid → **10 paying customers from personal network**

### 1.3 Create Simple Landing Page (Advisor-Focused)

**URL:** macrovesta.ai/advisors

**Content Structure:**

**Hero Section:**
```
Headline: Turn Your 10-Hour Friday Into a 30-Second WhatsApp Alert
Subheadline: Automate Cotton Market Report Analysis for Independent Advisors
CTA Button: "Book a 15-Minute Demo" (calendly link)
CTA Button 2: "Start 14-Day Free Trial"
Background: Cotton field or advisor at desk (Friday evening, tired)
```

**Pain Section (The Friday Problem):**
```
Headline: Stop Spending Every Friday Analyzing Reports

✓ Thursday 11 AM: USDA Export Sales drops → 2-3 hours analyzing
✓ Friday 3:30 PM: CFTC COT Report drops → 2-3 hours analyzing
✓ Friday evening: Writing client summaries → 2 hours
✓ Weekend: Catching up on Crop Progress, Cotton on Call → 2-3 hours

Total: 8-10 hours per week. Every. Single. Week.

Sound familiar?
```

**Solution Section (The Macrovesta Way):**
```
Headline: What If Friday Looked Like This Instead?

✓ Thursday 11 AM: WhatsApp alert → "USDA Export Sales: Net sales up 35% week-over-week for upland cotton. Bullish signal." → 30 seconds
✓ Friday 3:30 PM: WhatsApp alert → "COT: Managed money short 62,004 contracts, up 8,000 from last week. Bearish positioning." → 30 seconds
✓ Friday evening: Forward alerts to clients, add your insights → 5 minutes
✓ Weekend: Actually relax

Total: 6 minutes per week. Macrovesta automates the rest.
```

**How It Works (3 Steps):**
```
1. We Pull the Reports
   The moment USDA, CFTC, Cotton on Call, or Crop Progress reports drop, we grab them.

2. AI Analyzes the Data
   Trained on 10+ years of Earlam & Partners consultancy expertise, our AI interprets the numbers.

3. You Get Plain-Language Insights
   WhatsApp alert: "Managed money is short 62,004 contracts - they're betting cotton will fall."

Forward to clients. Make decisions. Get your Friday back.
```

**Social Proof:**
```

```

**Pricing (Transparent):**
```
£150/month or £1,620/year (save 10%)

Compare to:
- Bloomberg Terminal: £24,000/year (16x more, still requires manual analysis)
- Doing it manually: 10 hours/week × £50/hour × 52 weeks = £26,000/year in time

14-day free trial. No credit card required.
```

**FAQ (Address Top Objections):**
```
Q: How do I know the AI analysis is accurate?
A: Macrovesta is trained on decades of expert analysis from Earlam & Partners consultants. We use explainable AI - you can see exactly WHY we're making each interpretation. Plus, you can verify the underlying data yourself in 30 seconds.

Q: I prefer to do my own analysis. Why would I use this?
A: Your expertise is what clients pay for - we're not replacing that. We handle the tedious data gathering and initial interpretation. You still review everything (takes 30 seconds) and add your unique market perspective. You're just not spending 3 hours copy-pasting data from PDFs anymore.

Q: What if I don't use WhatsApp?
A: Email delivery is coming soon. For now, you can use WhatsApp Web on your computer. But here's why WhatsApp works: your clients are already there. Forward our alerts directly to client groups and save even more time.

Q: Does this cover all the reports I need?
A: Yes. We automate: CFTC COT, USDA Export Sales, Cotton on Call, Crop Progress. If there's a report you need that we don't cover, let us know.

**Target List:**
- **Trade association leaders** (National Cotton Council, ICAC, etc.)
- **Industry publication editors** (Cotton Outlook, Cotton Grower, etc.)
- **LinkedIn influencers** in cotton/commodities (10K+ followers)
- **Conference organizers** (can Joe speak/sponsor?)

**Ask Template (Email/LinkedIn):**

```
Subject: Quick favor - would you share this with your network?

Hi [Name],

Hope you're doing well! [Personal connection reference]

Quick favor: I've built a new tool for cotton advisors (Macrovesta) that automates the Friday report analysis grind - turns 10 hours of COT/USDA analysis into 30-second WhatsApp alerts.

It's getting great early feedback from advisors who are sick of spending their weekends analyzing reports.

Would you be willing to share this with your network / post about it / mention it in your next newsletter?

I'm offering free 14-day trials (no credit card) - here's the link: [Trial URL]

Happy to write the copy for you, or you can just forward this email. Either way would be hugely helpful.

If you want to try it yourself first, let me know and I'll extend your trial to 30 days.

Really appreciate it,
Joe

P.S. - If this takes off, I'd love to have you as an advisor to the company. Your feedback has always been invaluable.
```

**What to Offer:**
- Free extended trial (30 days instead of 14)
- Affiliate commission (10-20% recurring if they refer customers)
- "Advisor to Macrovesta" title (credibility for them)
- Co-marketing opportunities (joint webinar, case study, etc.)

**Expected Results:**
- 10 asks → 3-5 yeses

### 2.2 Guest Article Placements (Industry Publications)

**Goal:** Get Macrovesta mentioned in trusted industry publications

**Publications to Target:**
1. **Cotton Outlook** - Weekly newsletter (paid, but Joe has relationships)
2. **Cotton Grower Magazine** - Guest article opportunity
3. **AgFunder News** - "AgTech startup automates commodity analysis"

5. **LinkedIn pulse articles** by industry influencers

**Article Angle (NOT sales pitch):**

```
Title: "The Hidden Cost of Manual Report Analysis:
       Why Cotton Advisors Are Burning Out on Fridays"

Hook: Most cotton advisors spend 8-10 hours per week analyzing government reports.
      That's 480 hours per year - 12 full workweeks - doing work that could be automated.

Body:
- The Friday grind (COT at 3:30 PM, USDA Export Sales Thursday 11 AM)
- Time cost calculation (10 hours/week × £50/hour × 52 weeks = £26,000/year)
- Advisor burnout stories (weekends, family time lost)
- Technology solutions emerging (mention Macrovesta as one example)
- Call to action: "Try automation tools, reclaim your time"

This is NOT a sales pitch - it's thought leadership that positions Joe as solving a real industry problem.
```

**Expected Results:**
- 1-2 articles published in Month 1
- Each article reaches 5,000-20,000 readers
- 2-5% click-through → 100-1,000 clicks

**Monday: Educational Post**
```
"How to Read CFTC COT Reports in 5 Minutes (Not 3 Hours)

Most cotton advisors I talk to spend 2-3 hours every Friday analyzing COT data.

Here's the shortcut I use:

1. Focus on Managed Money positioning (speculators, not hedgers)
2. Look for week-over-week CHANGES (not absolute numbers)
3. Identify extremes (highest short in 6 months? That matters.)

This week: Managed money short 62,004 contracts, UP 8,000 from last week.

That's a bearish signal - large speculators betting cotton falls.

What are you seeing in the market?

**Wednesday: Behind-the-Scenes / Product Teaser**
```
"Building Macrovesta: Why I automated my Friday workflow

For 20+ years, I've spent every Friday evening analyzing COT reports.

3 hours. Every. Single. Week.

Last year I finally asked: 'What if AI could do this for me?'

So I built Macrovesta. Now I get WhatsApp alerts in 30 seconds instead.

Just launched free trials this week. DMs are open if you want to try it.

---

## Success Criteria: When to Move to Phase 2

✅ **GO to Phase 2 if:**
- 20+ paying customers
- £3,000+ MRR
- 5+ video testimonials collected
- Demo-to-paid conversion >30%
- Churn <15% in first month

✅ **PAUSE if:**
- <10 paying customers after 4 weeks
- Demo-to-paid conversion <20%
- High churn (>30% in first month)
- Consistent objection you can't overcome

**If PAUSE:** Fix messaging/product before spending money on ads.

**Wednesday:** Value demonstration
```
Example:

"What I Learned From Last Thursday's USDA Export Sales Report

Net sales for upland cotton:

→ 156,900 bales (up 35% vs prior 4-week average)
→ Primary buyers: China, Turkey, Pakistan
→ Cancellations: Minimal (bullish sign)

My take: Strong demand signal, especially with China back in the market.

Worth watching: Will this pace continue, or is this a one-week spike?

Advisors: How are you interpreting this for your clients?

#USDA #CottonExports #MarketAnalysis"
```

**Friday:** Results/testimonial
```
Example:

"Just got off a call with [Advisor Name], who signed up for Macrovesta this week.

His reaction when he got Friday's COT alert:

'Wait, that's it? I usually spend 3 hours on this.'

Exactly. That's the point.

If you're still spending your Friday afternoons copy-pasting data from PDF reports, there's a better way.

DM me and I'll show you how 30 seconds replaces 3 hours.

#CommodityAdvisors #Automation"
```

**Engagement Strategy:**
- Comment on cotton industry posts (Cotton Outlook, trade associations)
- Tag advisors Joe knows (with permission)
- Answer questions in LinkedIn groups (Cotton Trading, Commodity Advisors)
- Share other people's content with Macrovesta insights added

**Success Metric:** 3 posts/week → 100-200 impressions each → 5-10 profile visits → 1-2 demo requests/month

```
Pitch Email:

Subject: Article idea: "The Friday Problem in Cotton Advisory"

Hi [Editor],

I've been talking to dozens of cotton advisors over the past month, and I keep hearing the same complaint:

"I spend every Friday analyzing USDA and COT reports instead of spending time with my family."

I'd love to write a piece for [Publication] about:
- Why commodity advisors are drowning in data
- The hidden cost of manual report analysis (8-10 hours/week)
- How automation is changing the game (without replacing expertise)

I run Macrovesta (backed by Earlam & Partners' 10 years of consultancy work), but this wouldn't be a product pitch - more of an industry observation piece.

Interested? I can send a draft by [date].

Best,
Joe
```

**Tactic 2: Podcast Appearances**
- Cotton trading podcasts
- Agricultural commodity shows
- Small business marketing podcasts (different angle: "How we built a niche SaaS")

**Results Page (Personalized):**

**IF: Advisor + 10+ hours/week + Manual only:**
```
Your Result: "You're the Perfect Fit for Macrovesta"

Based on your answers:
- You're spending 10+ hours/week analyzing reports
- You're doing this manually (no automation)
- You're an independent advisor (our core customer)

Here's what would change with Macrovesta:
✓ 10 hours/week → 30 seconds/week
✓ Friday analysis → WhatsApp alerts
✓ £26,000/year time cost → £1,800/year subscription

**IF: Trader + 2-5 hours/week + Bloomberg user:**
```
Your Result: "You Might Benefit from Macrovesta (As a Complement to Bloomberg)"

Based on your answers:
- You already use Bloomberg (great for real-time data)
- But you still spend 2-5 hours/week analyzing reports

Macrovesta could complement Bloomberg by automating government report interpretation.

Many traders use both:
- Bloomberg: Real-time pricing, execution, comprehensive data
- Macrovesta: Automated COT/USDA analysis delivered to WhatsApp

Worth a quick demo to see if it fits your workflow?

```
Your Result: "You Might Not Need Macrovesta Yet"

## Market Expansion: Add Traders (Month 6+)

**Why Wait Until Month 6:**
- Advisors are easier to sell (established this in Phase 1-2)
- Need advisor testimonials before approaching traders
- Need refined messaging and proven product
- Advisors → Traders referrals might happen naturally

**Trader-Specific Messaging Adjustments:**

**Landing Page:** macrovesta.ai/traders

**Headline Change:**
- Advisors: "Turn Your 10-Hour Friday Into 30 Seconds"
- Traders: "Never Miss a Market-Moving Signal Again"

**Pain Points:**
- Advisors: Time scarcity (Friday grind)
- Traders: Risk (missing bearish signals, getting caught wrong-footed)

**Value Prop:**
- Advisors: "Automate your workflow"
- Traders: "Reduce risk with real-time intelligence"

**Messaging Pillar:**
- Advisors: Time savings (rational)
- Traders: Competitive edge (fear/urgency)

**Example Trader Ad:**
```
Headline: "While You Were Managing Logistics, Managed Money Went Short 8,000 Contracts"

Body:
Friday 3:30 PM: COT report drops.
You're in a meeting. You check it... tomorrow.
By then, the market's moved.

Macrovesta sends you a WhatsApp alert the SECOND reports drop:
"Managed money short 62,004 contracts, up 8,000. Bearish signal."

Make faster decisions. Reduce risk.

£150/month vs £24,000/year for Bloomberg.

14-day free trial.
```

**Trader-Specific Content:**
- "How to Hedge Cotton Risk with COT Data"
- "Case Study: Ginner Avoided £50K Loss with Early Warning"
- "Cotton Trader's Toolkit: 10 Essential Data Sources"

## Partnership Strategy (Month 6+)

**Goal:** Leverage other companies' audiences to scale faster

### Partnership 1: Data Provider Integration (e.g., AgFlow, Kpler)

**Pitch:**
```
"You provide raw cotton price data. We interpret government reports. Together, we serve the full advisor workflow.

Proposal: White-label partnership where AgFlow customers get Macrovesta analysis with AgFlow branding (revenue share). Or: Referral partnership (you send us advisors who need report automation, we send you advisors who need price data)."
```

### Partnership 2: Trade Associations (Cotton USA, National Cotton Council)

**Pitch:**
```
"Your members are commodity advisors who spend 10+ hours/week analyzing reports. We built a tool to automate that.

Proposal: We sponsor your next conference, offer members exclusive discount, and provide educational webinar on modern advisory tools."
```

### Partnership 3: Accounting/Back-Office Software (e.g., Ag-focused QuickBooks alternatives)

**Pitch:**
```
"You handle accounting for commodity advisors. We handle market intelligence. Our customers need accounting software, your customers need market intelligence.

Proposal: Cross-promotion. We recommend you to our customers, you recommend us to yours."
```

**Partnership ROI:**
- Each partnership could deliver 5-20 customers/month
- Lower CAC than paid ads (trust from association)
- Expands TAM (reach advisors not on LinkedIn)

---

## Phase 3 Results (Expected)

**Month 6 Snapshot:**
- **Total Customers:** 100-200
- **MRR:** £15,000-£30,000

- **LTV:CAC Ratio:** 12:1 to 18:1

**Channel Breakdown:**
- Google Ads: 30% of new customers
- LinkedIn Ads: 25%
- Webinars: 20%
- Organic (SEO, LinkedIn): 15%
- Referrals: 10%

**Expansion Revenue:**
- Upsell annual plans (10% discount = £1,620/year vs £1,800)
- Add-ons: Multi-commodity analysis (cotton + coffee + sugar)
- White-label: Advisors brand reports for clients (£50/month add-on)
